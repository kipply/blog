<p>The Blackberry movie was the best thing I’ve ever seen, it so perfectly captured how startup founders go insane and start believing deranged things about their company. Also had an iconic line where when Jim asked Mike something about “i thought these were the best engineers in the world” and the quote from the movie was “I didn’t say they were the best engineers in the world, I said they were the best engineers in Canada.” Anyway, I combed through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlackBerry">Blackberry wikipedia page</a> after that to keep my facts straight.

<p><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>Book: Rats</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></p>
<p>Upon moving to Sat Francisco, I <a href="https://kipp.ly/blog/sept-oct-2022/">read</a> Cool Gray City of Love and immediately wished for an equivalent for New York (I lived there on and off). It would be hard to do as a book about New York, as the cuteness of CGCL came from the fact that most of the chapters weren’t about the Gold Rush or Summer of Love but about local history that could only be engaging to someone sitting on top of it. Maybe a book about a specific neighbourhood would cut it, but how could I choose a neighbourhood?</p>
<p>I found Rats (Robert Sullivan) at a Battery Park City housewarming in September where the book was not just recommended to me, but physically handed to me (which is the ultimate purpose of keeping one’s books collection). I lived in the Robert Moses part of town (Alphabet City) in May and begrudgingly thought about giving the Power Broker an attempt but then realised now was definitely the time to pick up Rats — only to realise I had left it in San Francisco. Thankfully I returned in June and finished the book in a week. It lived up to my CGCL standard.</p>
<p>Sullivan and I disagree, in that I rather like rats, but the book could've surely had me mistaken. He never quite explains how someone who wouldn’t even fancy a fancy rat would spend a year researching and watching them — even traveling to Chicago to meet an exterminator celebrity.</p>
<p>The book pops back in forth between the present of Sullivans rat adventures and history involving rats ranging from that Manhattan dentist who tried to shoot the rats on Rikers to the role of rats in plague over centuries. It covers the animal rights activists who tried to stop rat fights and the sanitation worker strike of NYC. Rats ends with a beautiful memo to the type it uses and has the greatest cover — look it up!</p>
