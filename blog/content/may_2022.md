Please stop stepping on my acronyms, [OPT](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/democratizing-access-to-large-scale-language-models-with-opt-175b/) is a visa not a language model. [Gato](https://www.deepmind.com/publications/a-generalist-agent). [I'm](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/in-context-learning-and-induction-heads/index.html) [behind](https://www.deepmind.com/publications/improving-language-models-by-retrieving-from-trillions-of-tokens) [on](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html) [papers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15556). [Like](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/DeepMind.com/Blog/tackling-multiple-tasks-with-a-single-visual-language-model/flamingo.pdf) [really](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.14913.pdf) [behind](https://openai.com/blog/vpt/).  Good stats work on [best-of-n sampling](https://openai.com/blog/measuring-goodharts-law/) from OpenAI, not really about Goodhart's law. AIs doing things that [help](https://openai.com/blog/critiques/)! [Fanfiction](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/11/14/ai/).

It feels a little strange that I work on AI but we [can't even do colours right](https://lea.verou.me/2020/04/lch-colors-in-css-what-why-and-how/). [This](http://thbecker.net/articles/rvalue_references/section_01.html) is my life now. [Conflict free replicated data types](https://www.inkandswitch.com/peritext/#) should be called cfrdts. [Zstandard](https://facebook.github.io/zstd/#small-data/) is better zipping (particlarly high decompression speed) and offers speed/compression tradeoffs. Obviously better options for old tech, zstandard is this for compression, ripgrep for grepping, and [BLAKE2](https://www.blake2.net/) for hashing. It took [a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors) [few](https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/eigenvalue.html) [tries](https://math.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Linear_Algebra/A_First_Course_in_Linear_Algebra_%28Kuttler%29/07%3A_Spectral_Theory/7.01%3A_Eigenvalues_and_Eigenvectors_of_a_Matrix#:~:text=Definition%207.1.,-2%3AMultiplicity%20of&text=For%20example%2C%20suppose%20the%20characteristic,of%20multiplicity%20equal%20to%202.) but I learned about eigenvalues. [Wikipedia](http://prize.hutter1.net/) compression contest! [Cosmopolitan](https://justine.lol/ape.html).

Excellent format for [EA critique critique](https://nintil.com/critiques-ea). Excellent [EA critique](https://michaelnotebook.com/eanotes/). [EA critique](https://reboothq.substack.com/p/ineffective-altruism?s=r) that's too Gen Z. Investigating [Climate Change](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/climate-change/), see also, [Tweet Thread](https://twitter.com/ardenlkoehler/status/1526992382889283585). [Lovely!!](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20220615-do-we-need-a-better-understanding-of-progress)

[Memes are embeddings](https://mirror.xyz/herndondryhurst.eth/eZG6mucl9fqU897XvJs0vUUMnm5OITpSWN8S-6KWamY). Lim-lim-[limerence](https://ava.substack.com/p/the-agony-of-eros-on-limerence?s=r), my fave. Being [half-hearted](https://ava.substack.com/p/how-to-avoid-half-heartedness?s=r) seems hard, my crushes will receive maximum affection. [Creepiness](https://chrislakin.substack.com/p/thoughts-on-and-conjectures-about) as the feeling when you are playing an infinite game but someone else is treating it as a finite game.

I'm [sick of hearing about Twitter](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-05-02/twitter-s-board-gave-up) tbh. [Private Markets Will Pump The Oil](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-06-16/private-markets-will-pump-the-oil).
