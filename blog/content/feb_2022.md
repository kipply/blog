The one in which C.S. Lewis [tells me I'm silly](https://www.lewissociety.org/innerring/) for status chasing. [Networking fanfiction](https://paulbutler.org/2022/what-does-it-mean-to-listen-on-a-port/) as a method of education. Discovery non-fiction for the [modern Golang garbage collector](https://go.dev/blog/ismmkeynote) that saved the language. A cool person's [pipe dreams for more meta-JIT libraries](https://blog.redvice.org/2022/lineiform-rust-meta-jit/), now in Rust. Long awaited read for [Magic Trace](https://blog.janestreet.com/magic-trace/). [Cranelift codegen](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/tree/main/cranelift
). [Space governance](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/space-governance/) probably isn't that importractable yet, but we double checked to be sure.
