The path to earn-to-give effective altruism is mostly one of normalizing donating, not one of character development. Donations converted to CAD, if I donated through an organization that distributes to other charities, the charities that will be spending the money are listed.

2021 edit: I would've liked to put more money into less anthrocentric causes as well as put some money into meta-research
