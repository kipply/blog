# I Don't Want to be a Founder and I Don't Think You Do Either

I had a brief run with a startup (literally like a month) and was faced with the decision of going into a YC Cohort. As you might've guessed, I decided not to go and I genuinely believe that running a startup seems like a bad idea for the majority of people I meet who want to become founders. Don't take this post *too* seriously, everything here is opinion from my limited experiences. 

I've separated this post into two parts, and also scatter in notes about when becoming a founder is actually right for you.

- Reasons why being a founder is worse than people expect
- Common reasons why people want to be founders and how to get those features in industry 

# Ways Being a Founder is Unexpectedly Bad

### Commitment

I'm not talking about committment to your company - lots of people start bakeries or whatever that's years of commitment and lots of money. 

I'm talking about commitment to your cofounder (if you have one, which is likely). 

Being 18, I'm not very smart about romantic relationships, but I'd be iffy to marry my partner of two years even though they're well-employed, we rarely fight, they've supported me through more than I can describe and I can't imagine meeting anyone better. Marriage is scary! My finances, my social life, personal time and emotional wellbeing would be largely dependent on a single person and that's scary. It should be scary or should at least take a few years for it not to become scary. 

So your founder is...kind of the same? In a seed stage it's likely you *actually* live together, and if you don't you're likely functionally living together with the amount of work involved. They're responsible for your financial well-being. They may be responsible for the quality of your social lives (founders spend a lot of time socializing with other founders). They're tied to your life goals, your dreams and your passions.

My impression was that my relationship with my cofounder would be more intense than an actual damn marriage, and *extra* bad because in the likely event of failure, losing that relationship would be tragic. I totally believe that there are cofounder pairs that are completely ready to go through the founder journey and pairs that maybe weren't ready but were fine anyway, but I stand by the statement that it's more intense than marriage. 

### Your VC is Not the One at Risk Here

I often hear sentiments that resemble "wow these VCs are taking a chance on me I better commit to this!". 

VCs are not evil people trying to take advantage of you, but they are absolutely not the ones at risk. For them 150k (YC investment) or a few million is not a huge risk for them. Most of their returns will be from a very small percentage of their investments, thus they can afford to have comically high error rates as long as they get the few that matter. If you're SoftBank you can do even worse and still have so much money!

Your risk is years of your life, blood, sweat and tears. The next few years (provided your startup lasts till then) will be in service to these VCs and then some. It's good to take a risk because qualified people think you have promise. However, that can morph into "I'm going to work on this startup partially in service to these people who believed in me and gave me lots of money" which seems bad. 

### Sense of Self

This one is the one that got to me most but I can see it being irrelevant to a lot of other people. 

Many founders have big egos -- I don't mean they're assholes or overly self-important but they do have very powerful confidence, likely because that's a valuable skill to have as a founder. Not just confidence in pitching your project to others, but in your vision and your company. 

My first fear was that I created an ego for myself rapidly. Practicing to sell to clients and for your YC interview involves repeating to yourself why you are *good*. I love feeling good about myself, but I suddenly found myself feeling more confident in myself than what was warranted. More frighteningly, I had a major character and energy chance in a couple weeks. 

The other fear is coming down from that. Startup founders (especially the more eccentric ones) sometimes believe that they will without a doubt build something that will change the world. There's nothing wrong with that, but I also think it's exceptionally tragic to come down from that -- not because of the work or time put in but because shifting that mindset back seems painful. Your identity and your company start to merge, losing that is more than "getting over failure", you lose a part of your identity. Again, this might not apply to people who are less risk averse.

### Something to Own

Lots of huge, ground-breaking products have been lead from within a large company. Examples include email client `hey.com`, Chromebooks, and countless amazing dev tools. 

Starting these things in a large company has the benefit of security, resources and recruiting already done for you. Downsides could include beaurocracy, not being able to recruit on your own accord and dealing with PR policy.
