Steve Klabnik (ü¶Ä) on [AI discourse](https://steveklabnik.com/writing/i-am-disappointed-in-the-ai-discourse/), really pleasant to see old software engineering idols weigh in on my life‚Äôs work. Some [thoughts](https://www.thefp.com/p/ai-will-change-what-it-is-to-be-human) on how AI will change things, need more of this content with higher specificity and increased number of rollouts to actually understand though.

I had never heard of a [Rick Rubin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Rubin)! I think he could be an important concept, as a producer who maybe doesn‚Äôt have the skills for making music yet still provides real value.

### World Tour

I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about the world lately, and all I haven‚Äôt seen. I think if the world is about to drastically change really fast (and really soon) then I would like to know and understand as much of it as I can.

In historical tradition, I‚Äôll go East to West (ish). 

**Japan**

What can I say about Japan that hasn‚Äôt already been said? They‚Äôre the only country that that would have an earnest life-sized cardboard cutout of the late pope at a Catholic museum (found in Nagasaki). People are always complaining about tourists, but Kyushu during Golden Week was just Japanese tourists, who are adorable if not too excited about what is an aggressively mediocre Chinatown.  

Spoiler! Alert. If You Think There Is Any Chance You Will Be In Japan From Now Till October 13th, Stop Reading! 

Absolutely wild to me that not more people know about the World Expo. It‚Äôs like the World‚Äôs Fair but it‚Äôs still happening right now! In a hilarious fall from grace, the spectacle that brought us the likes of the Eiffel Tower and air conditioning, is now full of ESG slop and AI art. There are a lot of reasons for this fall, which can all be summed up as ‚Äúthe world got too big and things had to specialise‚Äù. 

I took the USA Pavillion tour in Chinese because the line was shorter, and the tour guide made a great deal of delineating the mainland from Taiwan. The exhibit advertised the Fulbright scholarship prominently (rip), and documented every single American space flight (including Blue Origin) *except* SpaceX. Staffed by State Department interns, it was a true Biden capsule. Taiwan did not get a traditional country pavillion, rather they had a spot outside the ring called Tech World, right next to the Gas Pavillion which kept talking about a mysterious ‚Äúe-methane‚Äù. Countries like Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan brought incredible production value, and upon looking up their GDP I learned they must be dictatorships. All the architecture there is stunning. The Korea pavillion had a huge screen (very conservatively at least 15x30 feet) that played 2016 GANs on loop. There is a cute mascot. The China pavillion had a sanctioned GPU and a section on ‚Äúfriendship‚Äù with the Japanese. There was a drone show and water show. Hat tip to Indonesia for having an earnest pavillion, but the other ones were really funny. I would‚Äôve spent at least two full days there if I budgeted for it. 

**New Hebrides** 

In a surprising libertarian twist, a [condominium colony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hebrides) in Oceania?! They had separate post offices and police forces for the French and British, with equal administrators on each side. Each administration had its own laws, currencies, immigration policies, and even had regulatory arbitrage. I asked people who would break a tie in case of a contention. Some answered the natives because they don‚Äôt understand hows colonialism works. My guess was the pope because I forgot about Martin Luther (sorry!). Idiots! Clearly, the King of Spain is the tie breaker. 

**China**

[Beijing Silvermine](https://www.beijingsilvermine.com/), an archive of negatives from 1985 - 2005. Some truly epic photos in here. Makes me nostalgic somehow, maybe the ancestral memory is in me somewhere. The [Chinese Periodic Table](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%85%83%E7%B4%A0%E5%91%A8%E6%9C%9F%E8%A1%A8). 

Do not [write madlibs](https://www.thewayofcode.com/) of ancient philosophical and religious texts! I don‚Äôt want to claim anything on the grounds of disrespect or offense here (I don‚Äôt even like Taoism), just that it‚Äôs ugly and crude. That website is the ÈÅìÂæ∑Áªè with word substitution for it to be about code in ways that don‚Äôt make sense. The referenced translator in that production, Stephen Mitchell, claims to have also translated the Bhagavad Gita, the Iliad, and *Job* which is a clear red flag even if you don‚Äôt notice that his translation is in large parts fabrication. Even fanfiction ‚Äî a far higher form of art ‚Äî of ancient texts has rarely been an aesthetically successful endeavour. The best is likely the Book of Mormon, which wins by a landslide unless you count the New Testament. If you want to think about Taoism, check out [this site](https://www.tao-te-king.org/).

**Korea**

Definitely learn [hangul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangul) which is the most incredible alphabet (there was a time where they almost incorporated traditional Chinese characters, thank goodness we are not in that timeline). They have some fairly unusual politics as well which you can read about on the [Blue Roof](https://www.blueroofpolitics.com/) website. When you visit, you can see a lot of downstream effects of the [Chaebols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaebol), the War and their economic boom. Also scroll down on the [Kimchi page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimchi#Baechu_(napa_cabbage)_kimchi), it goes crazy. The Chinese love to claim that anything that happened in Asia was them (except the things that they really don‚Äôt want to have been them). 

On the margin, Korea is probably the top country I‚Äôd recommend visiting. It‚Äôs beautiful, cheap, and full of unique culture that is not going to last long as either the ASI or birth rates will catch up to them. They have Chinese maximalism (artificial waterfalls, spas with waterslides), lack of western software, insane drinking culture and delicious food. There‚Äôs a lot of ‚Äúinsert tokens for utils‚Äù sort of energy. Their subway stations are stocked with modest numbers of gas masks and every city block has something about Dokdo and Jeju (two important islands for very different reasons, but in a way, the same reason). 

**USSR**

The second-most exciting experience I had on a recent trip to Vegas was talking to a Yugoslavian Lyft driver who I stayed in the car chatting to after arriving at the destination. There‚Äôs very little that is like the connection an emigrant has to their now non-existent country. It‚Äôs unlikely I‚Äôll ever see the fall of a nation on the scale of the USSR. 

The [Jewish Autonomous Oblast](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Autonomous_Oblast), highly recommend listening to the anthem. Reminds me of the King of Spain thing where it sounds ridiculous but then you think a little and it starts to make a lot of sense. The Soviets referred to the Jews as ‚Äúrootless cosmopolitans‚Äù in a historical [slur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_religious_slurs), though I‚Äôm told ‚Äúrootless‚Äù is somewhat of a bad translation and it‚Äôs more like ‚Äúwithout people‚Äù. 

Unfortunately thanks to their misfortune, the Soviets produced a lot of incredible art. Crime and Punishment is on my nightstand and I‚Äôm making good progress, and the Idiot remains in mind as I vividly recall a friend informing me that it is about me. 

I watched [Stalker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalker_(1979_film)) (my first Tarkovsky film), it was good? I was certainly engaged, affected even. It‚Äôs a difficult watch, I don‚Äôt know if I have anything to say. I‚Äôve been told I‚Äôm more of a Solaris girl. I watched the [Hedgehog in the Fog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThmaGMgWRlY) at least six times this month. Miyazaki loved it, but it also so perfectly captures the Soviet mindset. I‚Äôm extremely excited to watch Tale of Tales (but saving it) and the Overcoat, which has been in production for uh, 40 years now. I also watched a bit of [Cheburashka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheburashka) and it‚Äôs pretty good good. I watched the entirety of [Vinni Pukh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnie-the-Pooh_(1969_film)) of which there is like 30 minutes total and it‚Äôs way better than ‚ÄúWinnie the Pooh‚Äù though maybe people who grew up with American cartoons will disagree. 

[**Polish Haitians**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_Haitians)

**America, United States of**

[Man elevates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawnchair_Larry_flight) to 4,900 meters in a lawnchair, ‚ÄúAh, the difficulty is, ah, this was an unauthorized balloon launch, and, uh, I know I'm in a federal airspace, and, uh, I'm sure my ground crew has alerted the proper authority. But, uh, just call them and tell them I'm okay‚Äù he says. [Why don‚Äôt we use pleasure as an interrogation technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Midnight_Climax)? The [Mayflower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayflower) is underrated as a boat. If there was one thing I could go back in time to see in America, it would be the Civil Rights movement. It was an incredible situation of humanity, politics, heroism and leadership. What better year than 2025 to get into the Civil Rights movement? 

I‚Äôm always saying that musical theatre is The White American Art. I got the chance to see a local theatre put on [Pacific Overtures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Overtures), a Sondheim musical about the beginning of the Meiji Restoration. ‚ÄúPlease Hello!‚Äù is likely Sondheim‚Äôs lyrical masterpiece, and the show was artfully problematic in every single way all at once (though is straightforwardly pro-colonization).
