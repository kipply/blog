Bleak month, busy month.

[Sampling data based on importance](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.03169.pdf). [Derivative of top-p (nucleus) sampling](https://www.trentonbricken.com/Tail-Free-Sampling/), with really good theoretical reasoning as to why this should work better.

Overview of [Bing Chat mishaps](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jtoPawEhLNXNxvgTT/bing-chat-is-blatantly-aggressively-misaligned). Janus [on cyborgism](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/bxt7uCiHam4QXrQAA/cyborgism), which just makes me much more convinced that AI needs more theoretical and conceptual research. Anthropic research on [moral self-correction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.07459.pdf) came out! Turns out too many RLHF steps actually result in discriminating in favour of minorities. Flawed [paper on poisoning datasets](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.10149.pdf) on the web. OpenAI on [how AI Systems should behave](https://openai.com/blog/how-should-ai-systems-behave).

The [History of the Sears Catalog](http://www.searsarchives.com/catalogs/history.htm), I also read the catalog of course. Highlight for me was that the low-tier appliance line was called "challenge" as in "challenge toaster", "challenge waffle iron", etc. Reviewed Universal Distribution Absolute Self-Selection Assumption, from [yashkaf](https://putanumonit.com/2023/01/04/udassa/) and [Paul Christiano](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/QmWNbCRMgRBcMK6RK/the-absolute-self-selection-assumption) and it's still not super deep in my head. Ben Kuhn [goes to Anthropic](https://www.benkuhn.net/leaving/).
