I like Thinking Machines, but more than that, I’m grateful. For this [blogpost](https://thinkingmachines.ai/blog/defeating-nondeterminism-in-llm-inference/#how-do-we-make-kernels-batch-invariant) and for being an AI lab with good energy.  What [good taste](https://www.seangoedecke.com/taste/) means for software engineering, what [good system design](https://www.seangoedecke.com/good-system-design/#fnref-1) looks like, and what [great software design](https://www.seangoedecke.com/great-software-design/) looks like. Anthropic finally gets a fun [post-mortem](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/a-postmortem-of-three-recent-issues).  [Parasitic AI](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6ZnznCaTcbGYsCmqu/the-rise-of-parasitic-ai) is definitely real, I’m surprised by how easy it was.  Blog on building a [search engine from scratch](https://blog.wilsonl.in/search-engine/) with embeddings. I’ve always hated that search engines are keyword based, I need to be able to search for “good blogs” or at least,  “blogs like this one”.  Hudson River Trading is [trying Python lazy imports](https://www.hudsonrivertrading.com/hrtbeat/inside-hrts-python-fork/), so you don’t have to! Don’t say quant finance has never done anything for you.  Dwarkesh with some [expectations management](https://www.dwarkesh.com/p/timelines-june-2025) for ASI.  Meta saying [something](https://www.meta.com/superintelligence/).

An [update](https://asteriskmag.com/issues/10/reports-of-the-death-of-california-high-speed-rail-have-been-greatly-exaggerated) on California high speed rail.  A [briefing](https://asteriskmag.com/issues/10/brain-freeze) on cryonics. 

[It’s not the incentives, its you](https://talyarkoni.org/blog/2018/10/02/no-its-not-the-incentives-its-you/). My libertarian mindset is really into seeing the world as a pile of incentives and I love making the incentives good. That being said, I do just think that exceptional people overcome the incentives.  A beautiful [short story](https://joecarlsmith.com/2021/04/04/the-innocent-gene), the Innocent Gene.  What are the [jhanas](https://nintil.com/jhanas/#what-are-the-jhanas)? Jose again [on doing more things](https://nintil.com/agency).  [Reality has a surprising amount of detail](http://johnsalvatier.org/blog/2017/reality-has-a-surprising-amount-of-detail), and its a pleasant and epistemically fun thing. 

If I was born a lot sooner I would’ve been in a scene with people like [Gregory Bateson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_Bateson), they’re spiritually a lot like rationalists. I got a shirt with “Rigor alone is paralytic death, but imagination alone is insanity” from the official Deep Springs merch shop.  Expectedly, the Queer had really good publications back in the day. Exhibit [A](https://archive.qzap.org/index.php/Detail/Object/Show/object_id/421), [B](https://archive.qzap.org/index.php/Detail/Object/Show/object_id/526) and my favourite: [C](https://archive.qzap.org/index.php/Detail/Object/Show/object_id/527).  [Wittgenstein as a designer](https://www.dragonfly-eye.online/klew/wittgenstein-as-designer) and more Now-Time Wittgenstein [content](https://now-time.biz/products/duck-rabbit-wittgenstein).  When I was a kid I was told that different parts of my tongue taste things differently, which I initially didn't believe. So I took a sugar cube and applied it to different parts of my tongue and then saw the truth. This week I learned that I just psyched myself into thinking that and your tongue tastes the same everywhere and empiricism failed me. [Never update your beliefs](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/LCduhA4m3RhMjZJPA/why-you-should-never-update-your-beliefs). 

Do you think I could get a prescription for [this](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1126921/)?  The [average font](http://iotic.com/averia/).  The [stepped reckoner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepped_reckoner)! Someone should really 3D print these. [The Lion of Gripsholm Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion_of_Gripsholm_Castle).  The NFL is [uncrustables georg](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5854102/2024/10/24/uncrustables-nfl/), eating at least 80,000 uncrustables per year.  Nothing can make me understand the British psyche but [cheeky nandos](https://samkriss.com/2015/05/20/cheeky-nandos-or-what-wet-wrong/) got me close.  Sadism is named after [a guy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marquis_de_Sade), who is of course a Frenchman. 

Have you ever wondered who had the coolest career progression? It might be [King Zog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zog_I#President_of_Albania), who became the first King of the Albanians after being President and Prime Minister.  [Murder Inc](https://www.notion.so/July-August-September-October-Digest-29f97959445f80a6a355c7de1e580625?pvs=21), and a beautiful [walk through Brownsville](https://theneighborhoods.substack.com/p/brownsville-brooklyn?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F57840be3-5992-41fd-8b54-5a29bf3a14c8_2000x1575.heic&open=false) where I intend to go grab some Jamaican food and try to spot churches that were synagogues.  The [Mao Wikipedia](https://www.tracingwoodgrains.com/p/how-wikipedia-whitewashes-mao?utm_source=post-email-title&publication_id=863356&post_id=169533366&utm_campaign=email-post-title&isFreemail=true&r=7pvp8&triedRedirect=true&utm_medium=email) shenanigans. On the bright side, [some revolutions went spectacularly well](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velvet_Revolution), on the downside, it does justify some manner of Deng Xiaoping’s actions.  The [Orange Alternative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_Alternative) is even technically still active.   Korea had an incredible show of civic duty [protesting beef imports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_US_beef_protest_in_South_Korea). I really think about being born in the past somewhere in Eurasia a lot.

[Theories](https://www.evai.ai/en/post/disinformation-the-deepseek-hype-was-all-made-up-how-fake-accounts-managed-a-market-frenzy) about Deepseek hype being manufactured. Honestly regret reading it, I don’t need to care if it’s true.  A [snapshot](https://calv.info/openai-reflections) into OpenAI’s culture. I hope people everywhere are writing lots of documents now so we can look back and compare notes.  Never meet your heros and never ask for their AI takes.

Peking Opera Blues was an okay and funky movie!  Bugonia was perfect. I love that Yorgos just knows which of his movies will be box office hits and which won't.  I love that he opens the movie with castration and balding of Emma Stone.  Don't get spoilers.
