Ben Kuhn on staring into the [abyss](https://www.benkuhn.net/abyss/) as a core life skill. Bad Idea: it‚Äôs all about [water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic_empire). I‚Äôm not sure I endorse the results or the intention, but I like [the way this guy thinks](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/5mghcxCabxuaK4WTs/ycombinator-fraud-rates)! [Real books last longer than physical books](http://blog.archive.org/2022/11/15/digital-books-wear-out-faster-than-physical-books/), a win for the vintage. Hal Finney on [choosing life](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/bshZiaLefDejvPKuS/dying-outside). [The Gift We Give Tomorrow](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pGvyqAQw6yqTjpKf4/the-gift-we-give-to-tomorrow) ü•∫¬†I acquired [this sweater](https://boot-boyz.biz/products/kiesler-correalism) as the ultimate silicon valley wear, and read about Kiesler

Hillel on [universal SE topics](https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/universal-se-topics/), [dynamic typing](https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/i-am-disappointed-by-dynamic-typing/) the [etymology of ‚Äúboilerplate‚Äù](https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/why-do-we-call-it-boilerplate-code/) and his notes on [Strangeloop](https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/strangeloop-22/). Asterisk mag launched, and has a good introduction to [chips and China](https://asteriskmag.com/issues/1/china-s-silicon-future). 

Went on a meditation bender, here‚Äôs a [book review](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/your-book-review-why-buddhism-is) that correctly characterizes how Buddhist philosophy is bipolar. [Book review](https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/09/18/book-review-mastering-the-core-teachings-of-the-buddha/) about meditation. Another [book review](https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/11/28/book-review-the-mind-illuminated/) about meditation. [Meditation and sex scandals](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/10/16/is-enlightenment-compatible-with-sex-scandals/). [Buddhism in relation to rationality](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/HLERouG7QBt7jzLt4/zen-and-the-art-of-rationality). My experience with meditation is that it causes one to *experience* a philosophy of self (among some other things) and that does not induct that theory into truth. Buddhist philosophy is needlessly senseless because it‚Äôs reasoned from that experienced as opposed to more traditional technical thinking. It provides enhanced observational skills, but it‚Äôs not obvious that it‚Äôs correlated with ‚Äúliving optimally‚Äù as opposed to ‚Äúgoes insane‚Äù. 

[U-PALM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11399) improves PaLM compute by 2x. [Sandwiching](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.03540.pdf) paper from Anthropic.

Language models are really good at [generating evals](https://www.anthropic.com/model-written-evals.pdf).

Meta pretrained [science model](https://galactica.org/static/paper.pdf) Galactica, which offensively does not cite Minerva?? Finally read the [muP paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.03466.pdf) on zero-shot hyperparameter determination. [No press diplomacy](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.05492.pdf), though I didn‚Äôt make it to the full-press paper.

Excellent [compilation](https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/28/23427137/elon-musk-twitter-matt-levine-money-stuff) of Elon fucking with Matty. [Elon Musk Is Busy with Twitter](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-10-31/elon-musk-is-busy-with-twitter?leadSource=uverify%20wall), Matt Levine is busy with Elon. Oh boy the [Libor prosecutions](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-11-01/people-will-pay-for-illiquidity) are better than I could‚Äôve asked for. 

**********************************************************************Book: Structure of Scientific Revolutions**********************************************************************

Pleasant read, has really good narrative and was particularly fun because Kuhn focuses on the Copernican revolution, phlogiston theory and various other scientific progresses that I don‚Äôt know about because I‚Äôm uneducated. There are some obvious overfittings, dubious claims that were particularly uncomfortable for a clean bayesian approach to knowledge acquisition but also some nice tidbits about feelings, like Pauli‚Äôs personal crises. The book completes itself with a rather epistemically offensive plot twist. I have [1800 words of notes](https://www.notion.so/The-Structure-of-Scientific-Revolutions-80a1aaf4d6de4ef0ba628b3f0001d85e) on the book and probably some inspired upcoming writing. 

************Essay(?): Designing Freedom************

Designing Freedom is this Stafford Beer cybernetics ‚Äúbook‚Äù (according to Google, but it‚Äôs fifty pages). I don‚Äôt endorse it intellectually ‚Äî not at all, they make these stylized control diagrams that don‚Äôt actually work and big handwavy statements. But aesthetically ‚Äî super fun! I purchased another Beer book (who, by the way, has a daughter named ‚ÄúVanilla‚Äù. Vanilla Beer) called Platform for Change which I often skim through. I wrote [notes on this](https://www.notion.so/Designing-Freedom-55db24f3d01544a58b129892468848f5) too!
