(by the way, i highly recommend trying to dance with just your hands).\ndisciplined dancers can come after me but i recommend dancing without ever learning choreography. you will still get the exercise, self-expression and be able to expand your movement repertoire. i do still like classes once in a while for inspiration (but also following people i love) as well as guided freestyle or routine development classes, but i don’t think it’s necessary.\nmy comfort zone is ever expanding. my go-to style is a very modern pole dance — a lot of tension, kicks, body rolls, long lines to sensual music. here is an eleven second video of me moving in ways i never have before to really fast music, prompted by the music being released by a work fren of mine. &lt;3 \n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/misc/dance-not-choreo/","title":"I can dance, but I can't learn choreography"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/misc/group-hugging-theory/":{"body":"While one-on-one hugging is complicated enough as it is, the complications increase exponentially as number of people involved in the hug increase.\nThere are many intricacies with the one-on-one hug, such as whether you should have arms above or below the shoulders, how long and tightly you should hug, etc. But the general logistics of how the hug comes together is fairly simple.\nWith three people, it's also fairly doable to have a decent hug, as such;\n\nThe three person hug is also fairly intuitive, I've rarely seen it done incorrectly.\nWith a four person hug, a problem arises. You'll notice that the people on the outside are getting less hug.\n\nAt around five people, things start going to hell.\n\nWhat is this garbage??? Why does it look like a huddle? Are we playing football? At least it's better than going into \"flower petal\" mode, where people form a circle hugging people on the inside. Flower petal mode causes dramatic imbalance with the amount of hug each person gets.\nThere has to be a better way!

(but then why was it easy?) is a new incantation always better than an old one? \ncertainly not all incantations are made the same. “pull your shoulders towards the ground” would’ve done incorrect things. i’ve also been told to “twist into [my] stomach” which just thoroughly confused me but helped other students. \nyou can break down what i call incantations to be “the meaning of words” and their “connotations” and just “learning by association”. yet every time someone tells me to open my heart, i feel like there’s some code hidden in there that somehow tells me exactly what to do, without me knowing exactly what i’m doing. \nincantations. \n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/misc/incantations-of-movement/","title":"Incantations of Movement"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/misc/smarter-because-you-move/":{"body":"this is not something i would claim to people like “hey maybe if you could raise one eyebrow you would be smarter”, but control of your body is a nervous system process, which is reasonably considered relevant to intelligence. i happen to think that your nervous system is incredibly dumb. the amount of control i have over my body tells me that my brain is very bad at communicating with my body — it’s stupid. \noctopi are considered very smart, but they don’t use their nine brains to build computers, rather they can control each of their suction cups individually. that’s very impressive to me because here i am, a human controlling a metal machine that stores data and uses the internet and i can’t raise an eyebrow. \n“well that’s fine” you say, “why would you need to raise your eyebrow? it’s hard for you to isolate your other fingers, but you can move your thumbs with great control. your body is fine!”\nto that, i shall share the tale of the trap muscle that won’t activate. if you don’t go to the gym, you might look at the muscle and think “how the fuck am I supposed to move that” and that would be a correct response. \n\nif you do weight lifting, then you might be thinking of specific exercises and how they target your low/mid/upper traps differently. you might still be unable to flex it without doing one of the exercises or without also tensing another muscle. \nif you’re me, you do a lot of hanging from your arms and inversions. you also do a lot of hunching over your computer and sticking your neck out. you have very strong shoulders and pec muscles (it’s side boob muscle) and a fairly weak neck. your traps are by no means weak because you need back muscles for many things. \nbut then if you did one of those trap exercises, it’s so fucking hard! \na fun thing with muscles, is that they do actually move and pull to exert force. that means if you press on it it, they can’t exert force. \none day i was given a trap exercise and i said “noooo this is so hard”. then my pec muscle was pinched, and the trap exercise became easy, though for the first time ever i actually felt my trap working. \nwhat happened to my body was that my pecs were so used to doing all the work, that they would activate and kick in even when my traps should be doing the work — and would be better at the job. \ni went home with new exercises to really focus on learning to activate my traps — this is different from the intention of strengthening. i need to teach my traps to activate when they’re supposed to, and learn how to identify when my traps are activated vs when another part of my body is trying to take over. there are some exercises associated with this but the hard part really is teaching my body parts, nervous system and brain some new skills. \nas a software developer, i often assume that the default behaviour is ok when actually the default behaviour is dumb. in engineering this happens often because there are so many different use cases, but this is my BRAIN and my PEC they are literally right next to each other, grew up together, evolved to complement each other and they really should not be able to fuck up default behaviour. \nthe extended narrative is that maybe the default behaviour was fine but i, as the engineer, fucked it up because i toggled it to custom behaviour by making my pecs work more, but a good (nervous) system should really emit some kind of warning to tell me i’m choosing to do something a stupid way. \nat the gut level, i feel dumb when my body doesn’t do what i want because it’s limited by the same mechanism that prevents me from calculating logarithms in my head (you can argue that this is wrong, but it feels that way). i would like to explore if these skills are transferable or if i will “feel smart” when i learn to activate my traps or isolate different parts of my abs. \n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/misc/smarter-because-you-move/","title":"Smarter Because You Move"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/misc/some-thoughts-on-giving/":{"body":"So my recent thoughts about giving have been about how much I give (time, objects, money) out of guilt, and how much good actually comes out of what I give. \nIdeally, what I give should be very helpful by some measure, and I should not do have to it out of guilt or responsibility. I got the second one down early, as my giving throughout high school was mostly in organizing educational events or writing open source software. Late in high school, I became familiar with a movement called Effective Altruism which really got me thinking about how relatively useless spending tens of thousands of dollars and more man hours than I can count organizing a three-day programming contest for college kids is. \nAnd so began a guilt trip! All those charity ads about starving African children, abused women, abandoned puppies etc made me feel shitty about myself and the world, not that there's any wrong with that kind of advertising. It did make me want to give, not out of generosity or care but because I felt like I didn't deserve things I had, and that I shouldn't be happy. I hide away from things that make me feel guilt or disgust like that, because those are negative emotions that feel bad. I like feeling happy, but what if I could expand the amount of things that make me feel happy? So I pulled a pretty selfish move and didn't donate until I could be happy and confident doing so. \nSo here are the things I did / went through to get myself feeling good, and \"guilt-free\" about donating. This ended with me donating 10,000 to the Future of Humanity Institute, about 20% of my untaxed income over the past two years.\n\nAsk your friends to convince you. I want to be convinced that giving away some money would be good feel good. I care about my friends' opinions, and so talking to my friends in effective altruism was helpful. At the same time, I'm very against peer pressure so watch out for that!\nResearch what it costs to do X for another person. Think about how much you'd spend to get that for yourself, a friend or a stranger on the street.\nThink about what your \"worst case\" is. This sounds depressing, but was helpful for me since I was taking money away from potential family illness, unemployment or need to pay tuition. These cases are highly unlikely, and more importantly, my worst case situations did not seem significantly more frightening with some missing money. \nDe-guilting by thinking about hedonic adaptation. When I hear about people struggling my empathetic brain signals go off and I start feeling very very bad, because if that happened to me tomorrow I think I'd be in incredible pain. It's usually true that things are better than one expects them to be (there are studies on this too) and also that people can reestablish a base line. \nCalibrate against your mind-tricks playing with your emotions. I realized I would instantly pay 5000+ to save a stranger dying right in front of me, but maybe not even want to spend money to save people in the future. \nThink less about saving current lives, and more about saving future lives. This is also in line with being effective, as a general concept is that there are more people in the future than there are in the present. It's much harder to feel guilt-tripped when the message is more \"people in the future might be sad!\"\nThink about how much money you actually need / use. What amount of coveniences or luxuries compares to the live of another human being? What amount is unused? I personally found that I was being too cautious with saving money.\nPick an issue that you're passionate about, and feel positively about. I donated to the Future of Humanity Institute to work on human-aiding research and development. One of their focusus in AI Alignment, and as someone who works at an AI company, I care about the issue and can enjoy reading their research. They also study existential risk, biotechnology and fund altruistically motivated researchers -- all of which are pretty great and interesting to me.\nLook into giving tax-efficiently! Canada will let you claim 15-29% in tax credits! \nHOW SATISFYING WILL IT FEEL THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY HELP PEOPLE SO EASILY. Being able to donate and be happy doing so is just so great. It means that you can feel more like you have an abundance of resources, which is a wonderful freeing feeling. You can spend your money to buy yourself happiness, affect your character and be a positive impact for the world. Honestly, I self-hypnotized a bit and repeated these concepts to myself to get here.\n\nBut where do I stop? How do I live with myself eating out almost every day in a nice apartment and buying clothes I only wear once or twice? Well haha I'm selfish I suppose. I don't have very clear thoughts about this yet, but I'm happy giving an amount I feel comfortable with you everyone else should too!\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/misc/some-thoughts-on-giving/","title":"Some Thoughts on Giving"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/tech/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/tech/","title":""},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/tech/founding-bad/":{"body":"I had a brief run with a startup (literally a month) and was faced with the decision of going into a YC Cohort (W20). In that fiasco, I also spent at least twelve hours trying to convince other people to go. It's been half a year, and I've had a lot more time to reflect on reasons as to why one might want to run a startup. As you might've guessed, I decided not to do it and I genuinely believe that running a startup seems like a bad idea for the majority of people I meet who want to become founders, which seems to be a shocking number of people. \nThis post definitely will not apply to everyone, but I'd hope there's some valuable thinking in here. Also, note that this is fairly oriented towards technical founders. \nEdit: This post also has a very limited scope as it's based off the thinking from my decision to continue interning at Shopify or to go to YC. It's very focused on the Silicon Valley \"startup\" where you get a VC to give you money and get big in a year, etc etc\nWays Being a Founder is Unexpectedly Bad \n\nCommitment \n\nI'm not talking about commitment to your company. I'm talking about commitment to your cofounder (if you have one, which is likely). \nMaybe I'm too young to understand, but marriage seems frightening! My finances, my social life, personal time, and emotional wellbeing would be largely dependent on a single person and that's scary. It should be scary or should at least take a few years for it not to become scary. \nYour cofounder is...kind of the same? In a seed-stage it's likely you actually live together, and if you don't, you're likely functionally living together with the amount of work involved. They're responsible for your financial well-being. They may be responsible for the quality of your social lives (most founders spend a lot of time socializing with other tech people + founders). They're tied to your life goals, your dreams, and your passions.\nMy impression was that my relationship with my cofounder would be more intense than marriage, and extra bad in the event of failure since there's additional loss (and it's statistically likely, but I guess so is marriage). I totally believe that there are cofounder pairs that are completely ready to go through the founder journey and pairs that maybe weren't ready but were fine anyway, but I stand by the statement that it's more intense than marriage and not enough people put care into this. \nYour VC is Not the One at Risk Here \n\nI often hear sentiments that resemble \"wow these VCs are taking a chance on me I better commit to this!\". \nVCs are not evil people trying to take advantage of you (actually they might be, but let's assume they're not), but they are not the ones at risk. For them, 150k or a few million is not a huge risk. Seed-stage returns will be from a very small percentage of investments, thus VCs can afford to have comically high error rates as long as they get the few that matter. If you're SoftBank you can do even worse and still have so much money! They make decisions carefully, they care about your success for various reasons, and are generally caring people (in most of my experiences) but in larger abstractions, your startup means nothing to them. \nThey're not shy about it either, the entire reason they're investing in you is because they think you're more valuable than you cost. \n\nYour risk is years of your life, blood, sweat, and tears. The next few years (provided your startup lasts till then) will somewhat be in service to these VCs. The VCs are your \"bosses\" as you answer to them (though much less than a regular \"boss\") and to the ones you hope to raise capital from in the future. \nIt's good to take a risk with increased confidence because qualified people think you have promise. However, that can morph into \"I'm going to work on this startup partially in service to these people who believed in me and gave me lots of money\". These additional stresses that come from meeting VC expectations and the complications of the dynamics of that relationship get pretty stressful.\nSense of Self \n\nThis one is the one that got to me most but I can see it being irrelevant to a lot of other people. \nMany founders have big egos -- I don't mean they're assholes or overly self-important but they do have very powerful confidence, because that's a valuable skill to have as a founder. Not just confidence in pitching their project to others, but in their vision and their company. They need to believe their company will be successful (though I have met founders who just want to party with VC money for a few years cough cough Neumann). \nMy first fear was that I created an ego for myself rapidly. Practicing to sell to clients and for your YC interview involves repeating to yourself why you are good and self-hypnosis is fairly powerful. I love feeling good about myself, but I suddenly found myself feeling more confident in myself than what I believed was warranted. More frighteningly, I had a major character and energy change in a couple of weeks. Losing so much of my identity like that was unnerving, not to mention the ripple effects that could've occurred in my social life (they had already some what started but were revertable).\nThe other fear is coming down from that. Startup founders (especially the more eccentric ones) sometimes believe that they will build something that will change the world. Along with that, their identities start to merge with their company. There's nothing wrong with that, but I also think it's exceptionally tragic to come down from that. It's not just dealing with failure and getting back up on your feet, it's losing a part of your identity. \nSchool is Generally a Good Idea (for prospective dropouts) \n\nBeing a good engineer seems underrated for being a good startup founder. Not just being able to code fast, but being able to make good engineering decisions, conduct good technical interviews and attract talent. Some engineering skills can't be worked around with \"I am very smart and can learn fast\" and require extended time and practice. With that, I also think prospective founders also overestimate the amount of learning on the job that can be done on the engineering side, mostly because there will just be much less technical work. It's true that founders will learn more than they will in school or industry, but the technical development may not be as strong. My model is that the best schooling experience is better technical education than the best founding experience. \nCommon reasons why people want to be founders and how to get those features elsewhere \n\nSomething to Own \n\nLots of huge, ground-breaking products have been lead from within a large company. Examples include email client hey.com, Chromebooks, and countless amazing dev tools. \nStarting these things in a large company has the benefit of security, resources and recruiting already done for you. Downsides include beaurocracy, not being able to recruit on your own accord and dealing with PR policy. There is also high barriers to starting something within a company, like being senior enough to do so and being at the right company at the right time. \nThe alternative is starting a project on the side. Ziglang was started as a side project and is now a very promising programming language. The creator has since then left his job to work on Zig, but it is also possible to \"own\" something significant without even having to leave your job. Examples includes Julia Evan's blog (not actually a work-side-project) and line of zines, Cassidy William's keycap line, Nick Frosst's successful and awesome band and many more. I understand that it's not the extent of \"oh yeah Google? I built that\", but I think the expected value is much higher in creating and owning something that isn't a startup. \nGetting Rich \n\nA lot of people claim that startups are less money, but I find for signicant number of founders, that's not true -- not because they'll definitely have a good exit, but because they're skilled in ways that allow them to raise enough money to pay themselves like they would at a big company. If that applies to you, then going to a startup probably is your best shot at getting rich! For other people, the expected value of industry (particularly joining a well-funded early-stage startup) is usually higher. \nNot Being at School (for prospective dropouts) \n\nThis seems like a valid reasons for the average CS student. School is a place where you answer to professors who don't always understand industry and do homework assignments that no one will care about. However, it seems like all of these problems can be significantly if not fully solved by building a better school experience for yourself. \nA better program can improve many things, such as Olin College of Engineering that has a project-based curriculum, Make School that is a two year applied-engineering degree program or Dev Degree, where you can work at Shopify and take more applied courses taught by Shopify throughout your degree. These programs are small and selective, but probably not harder than a semi-successful startup. Dev Degree also happens to be more financially sound, with Shopify paying for your tuition and a salary, and Make School tuition is 70k for the entire degree. Olin is actually expensive so a better program may actually be financially unviable for potential startup founders.\nAnother alternative is to just be worse at school and learn on the side and/or to morph your silly school assignments into productive skills and useful outputs. The Coconut Programming Language was built by someone while they were in school. Some things like dynamic programming that are often deemed useless theoretical things can have industry applications. People have also taken mundane school projects like this compiler that almost every school will have you build in a compilers course and end up with educational findings for engineers in general (also see HackerNews thread). In five weeks, my friend Maas was able to launch five relatively successful products while enrolled in Dev Degree. \nSchool is already a powerful environment of hardwork, fun and learning. I think it is a more cohesive enviromnment than the startup world. It is fully possible to build useful software and learn \"useful\" skills while at school. There are also a bunch of other reasons why not to drop out of school and why school is fun, though those have been argued by those more qualified than me. \nFreedom to work on what you want \n\nI covered this a bit in previous sections, but prospective founders (and people and general) tend not to like industry jobs because they don't always get the pick the most interesting things to do and have a limited selection to begin with. \nFinding a perfect job that lets you do everything you want is pretty hard, but I also think that the free-est industry job is much more free than running a startup, unless answering to shareholders, dealing with recruiting, management and paperwork are things you find interesting. I couldn't find many accounts of people with jobs like this, but I know a few personally so I'll describe. \n\nShopify has a team that is dedicated to shorter projects that are created and selected by the team and not demands that are sent from executives. \nMy own team at Shopify (we worked on TruffleRuby) was experimental by nature and thus there was a lot of free reign to try things that are the most interesting. Furthermore, Shopify gave me a lot of room to work on + publish blog posts and go to conferences. \nFreelance engineers who get to pick their projects and then do them on their own accord. There are also a lot of full-time open source maintainers.\nResearch jobs or doing a graduate degree where almost anything can go!\n\nFame and Recognition \n\nI really debated this section since I haven't met a founder who was like \"oh I'm doing this so I can be famous and recognized for my talents\". However, I think it's a strong desire that rightfully manifests healthily in a lot of founders. I don't think I need to give examples for profilic individual contributors, but I also understand that there are less of them than prolific founders. This one is hard to replicate elsewhere though you can certainly get very close.\nAmbition \n\nI think this is the one that confuses me the most when people want to become founders. Phrases like \"I want to do better than just being another engineer\" don't really seem to be about ambition. \nTo be ambitious often means things like wanting to do a Ph.D, become a medical doctor or an astronaut. On that scale, it's not really about being better at something you're doing (though it partially is), but joining a new game where it's supposedly harder. I believe that running a successful startup is indeed harder than being a good engineer and is more ambitious on that axis. However, I think the games are close enough that ambition can easily be matched without changing the game. Setting goals like working at a certain company, promotions (up to positions like CTO) and leading a successful product at a company aren't strictly less ambitious than building a successful startup. \nEnjoying risk, Passion about a very specific product/service that can only be done at a startup \n\nAnyway to summarize here's a list of reasons I think are particularly convincing for people who want to start a company:\n\nThey want to build something that can't be built in any other place. This should be more like \"this thing has been bothering me forever and I need to fix it\" and less \"let's go find something to fix\". \nMoney, fame+recognition\nEnjoyment of risk (note that this is somewhat distinct from being adventurous)\n\nThese reasons don't really manifest on their own so it's hard to evaluate, as I'm pretty certain all people feel the first point to some extent. \nAll this to say, I'm scared that people are too eager to run a startup because it's glorified and seems virtuous (brave, hardworking, ambitious, smart, unique) when it's secretly not-that-great.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/tech/founding-bad/","title":"I Don't Want to be a Founder and I Don't Think You Do Either"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/tech/hackathon-tips/":{"body":"It's been almost been about three years since my first hackathon and I've now won prizes at nine hackathons (more if you count meme/small hackathons), organized judging at a hackathon and was a judge myself twice. Crafting the perfect project is certainly isn't a science, but I've found some things that usually work™.\n1. Don't skimp on the brainstorming. \n\nMost hackathons work out to judge with 25% from technical difficulty. Some hackathons might value usability as another 25% which could also be related to your coding. Yeah it's a coding competition, but you must have the right idea. I have been able to get around this annoyance if I notice a number of technical judges who will appreciate a project just because it's cool &lt;3. Here are a few questions I think about regarding an idea;\n\nIs this novel? If not, does it do it much better than the original?\nIs this impactful? How soon will it be impactful, and will that impact demo well?\nIs this technically interesting? If not, how can it be spiced up?\nHow will this project demo?\n\n2. Don't skimp on the planning. \n\nWorking in a team is hard. Trying to design a full featured project and build it in 36 hours is hard. Sleep deprivation makes it worse. Trying to figure out what needs to get done and how will be insanely hard. Planning includes making sure that all team members know what they're doing, and how all the parts will fit together. If a certain feature depends on another one, it would be a good time for someone to sleep. When considering \"optional\" features, set a time so that you know at which point you should give up and move onto something more essential. When planning, consider that some features may be a pain to implement but will never show up in the demo, or will only partially show up in the demo. For those, just have a UI or a single type of case that can be demoed and let the judges know.\n3. Pair. \n\nCode written at hackathons is bad, and gets exponentially (may be factorial, more data is needed) worse as time progresses. It's almost always more efficient to have someone around for a sanity check, especially if they wrote some of the surrounding code.\n4. Start by programming the \"new\" things. \n\nCoding when tired is hard. Reading documentation when you're so tired that everything is blurry is hard. If you're working with a new kind of database, write yourself a query/push/update/delete first, and let your team know where it is. Same goes for SDKs, sending requests from React for the first time, etc. People often don't do that, since it yields working \"parts\" more slowly, but trust me this is #worth. This also means being A G I L E and spreading out your work rather than fully finishing one \"part\" then moving onto the next. Additionally, this will let you know early on if something isn't technically feasible.\n5. Have a good sleeping pattern. \n\nPower naps are much more efficient than just crashing for twelve hours near the end. I like to wake up for the last six hours of the hackathon. This gives me enough rest to be able to efficiently rescue last-minute bugs and demo without being a zombie. Another good time to sleep is right after planning, though I like to have one person awake to scaffold the project. It's near impossible for four people to actively work on a fresh project at the same time.\n6. Talk to sponsors and judges during the hack. \n\nThis is especially great when going for category/API prizes. Most people will be willing to give some pointers or new ideas that would make your hack more interesting. Sometimes it'll be more like \"Dude, this idea will never work ever\". With API prizes, they may share some magical feature that you didn't know about and will save you hours. On top of that, the sponsors will (hopefully) have a better impression of your team. Often I have projects with an \"Oh shit\" moment, or a \"LITTY!!!!\" moment that are I wouldn't have without talking to others.\n7. Demo and talk. \n\nJudges can get seriously bored listening about the next big thing. Never separate the \"talk\" and the \"demo\". Just do it at the same time. Demos are flashy, and you want to make sure to capture every possible feature. Rehearse your demo more than your speech (especially if the project is somewhat buggy). Another point to mention, is that your idea should be awesome to demo. This often means hardware, things happening in realtime or some other magical \"waaaaaw\" moment.\n8. Don't bullshit. \n\nMaybe the one judge you get doesn't catch it, but they'll tell the other judges who likely will. I've disqualified people who comically oversold, totally missed the idea of blockchain, reused ideas or made up some facts about MRI scans (seriously?).\n9. It's a good sign if your judge asks questions. \n\nUsually, they're not just trying to hurt your feelings and/or ruin your life. They're actually interested in how your project works. How you answer these questions are easily more important than the initial demo. Remember that when they ask a question, it's not an invitation to start discussing an entire different aspect of your project. I've yet to encounter any question that would take more than a few sentences to answer.\n10. STOP TALKING. \n\nIf a teammate answers a question, you don't need to add-on (unless it was seriously inadequate). If a feature is described, the implications of that feature are often intuitive. If your project is interesting enough, then it's always safer to say less as then the judges will ask questions. Even if it isn't interesting, a lot of judges will pick up on fact that you may have undersold and will prod you about it.\n\nOther silly things that aren't quite worth another point or related to winning;\n\nStressed programming is also bad. Go play games; go cup stacking or do yoga. PET THE THERAPY DOGS. Plus if you win cup stacking, you're still a H A C K A T H O N W I N N E R 🤔\nSometimes when you're REALLY tired, you start forgetting what you're trying to do. Try making a list of comments in your code as a to-do list.\nBe awake for closings. Having your team showing up to the stage and being like \"Where is John? Oh I see he's passed out on the table back there.\" is awks.\nDon't try to build a project that covers every single category and API prize.\nFeed yourself. But not just chips. Have a salad.\nWrite decent commit messages; especially for the last couple hours. Finding a bug during demos and having no idea when it happened is very yikes.\nOther people will hate you if you use blockchain wrong. Or if you just plug a random model into AR. Or if you use an API and advertise your \"machine learning\" hack.  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯. It will sometimes push you towards a win but do you really want to win that way? DO YOU?\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/tech/hackathon-tips/","title":"10 Tips for a Winning Hackathon Project"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/tech/iconic-computer-science-images/":{"body":"Over the years I've noticed some images (not diagrams or graphs) that are recognizable to programmers. These images also often have backstories that contain educational information, so here they are! \nLena \n\n\nLena is a Swedish model and this photo of her is from a Playboy cover. Her name is sometimes spelled \"Lenna\" to encourage her name to be pronounced as \"leh-nah\" instead of \"lee-nah\", which is a mildly amusing parallel to classification tasks. The full image has her mostly nude. \nThe photo was first used six months after release in 1972 because of the mixture of textures and colours for testing an image compression algorithm. This eventually led to JPEGs (first released 1992). It's was standard to use the image to showcase differences between image compression algorithms .\nFor obvious reasons, having a nude model be the face of all image processing has raised concerns. Still there are blog posts, papers and websites that still use Lena for image processing, though recently it's been about computer vision, style transfer, etc. \nThe Cornell Box \n\n\nAnyone who has taken a graphics course has seen this box as it was first presented at a SIGGRAPH in 1984. It consists of five planes, an overhead light, a rectangular prism and cube. Variations are often seen with spheres of different materials such as dielectrics (glass),  and metals instead of lambertians (the matte texture). \nFor a raytracer (or pathtracer) this tests a lot of important features. The shadowing of the rectangle onto the wall, contrasting wall colours that should emit some colour onto the white (this is called diffuse reflection). \nAs shown below, it can also showcase (or rather, suffer from) tone mapping, which is a technique used to map a set of colours to another to make the range look \"dynamic\" or at least correct. The image below has a bug where the lack of tonemapping causes the image to bug out where it tries to make the colour brighter than a pure white pixel. \nAnother issue with the image below is the noise, which can be fixed by more sampling in this specific case as it's a monte carlo ray tracer, so it uses some brute force and randomization as computers can't actually simulate light going in infinite directions. \n\nOther classic rendering images include the Stanford bunny and the Utah teapot. It's been a meme to hide the Utah teapot into random scenes, and the teapot is the graphics version of \"Hello World\". It appears in Toy Story, the Simpsons, a Windows screensaver, and the Sims. Here's a 2.5 minute video about the teapot from Tom Scott. \n\n\nThe Big Red Mobile \n\n\nCLRS! The iconic graphic on the textbook is obviously representative of a tree, but it's actually based on a piece of art. It was made by Alexander Calder in 1959. If you don't already know about mobiles, they're really cool, carefully engineered to work with equilibrium and air currents. Big Red, made from sheet metal and steel weird, can be found at the Whitney Museum of American Art! \nFun fact, Cormen (the C in CLRS) and co wanted to recolour the depiction to use red and black, but the Calder estate would not allow it. You can also purchase similar versions of the mobile.\nThe Dragon Book Cover \n\n\nThis popular compilers textbook is often referred to as the \"Dragon Book\" because of the 🐉.The Dragon's shirt says \"Complexity of Compiler Design\", the shield says \"Syntax Directed Translation\" and the sword says \"LALR Parser Generator\". The older edition also has the knight riding a horse labeled \"Data Flow Analysis\". \n\nSyntax Directed Translation \n\nThe shield describes a method where the compilation is guided by the parser, and describes a more simpler subset of compilers. Syntax directed translation is a method of implementation used on context-free grammars (there's a whole linguistics thing behind this, but it's mostly what it sounds like) as a Type 3 language (on the Chomsky Heirarchy) could not be driven by the parser. There aren't too many commonly used languages that would be described as completely context free though there are languages that only have small caveats to become CFGs (not to be confused with control flow graphs, another compilers concept). If you want to read more, this Stack Overflow question is a good start. \nAnywho, this is likely the shield because it prevents any blurring of \"execution\" and \"compilation\" by not having any ambiguities embedded in the grammar. \nLALR Parser generator \n\nLALR is a type of parser (look ahead left to right) that is simpler than an LR parser (left to right, rightmost derivation) but more powerful than LL parsers (left to right, leftmost derivation). Parser generators greatly improve the pains of writing a parser. GCC started off with a parser generated (it's handwritten as of 2004), CPython makes their own LL* parser generator (*it's a bit variant, CPython devs may correct me), Haskell+OCaml+Ruby are on LALR generators. \nWriting a nice parser that works, is fast and surfaces nice syntax errors is a difficult design task, and a bit tedious after designed! Hence the dragon will be slayed by a LALR parser generator (YACC is taught in the book). \nData Flow Analysis \n\nData flow analysis is what it sounds like, tracking the movement of variables or other stored memory through a program. It is represented as the horse the knight is riding probably because it powers most things. I tried to think of why it might be removed from the cover, but there's no obvious answer and everything I came up with just sounded like a conspiracy theory. \nO'Reilly Animals \n\n\nIconic meme-able book covers! But who draws them? Who picks the animals when the book is not just called Python? Why are they pictures of animals?\nO'Reilly claims that this originated in the weirdness of Unix terms like awk, sed and yacc, and really the rest of it was \"it just clicked\". Many of them were drawn by one Lorrie LeJeune, and were done with pen and paper! There are also amusing stories of complaints from the arachnephobic who had to deal with spiders on covers. You can find a list of all the books and animals here.\nEdie Freedman, the creative director who saw over this claimed that there's meaning to how all the animals that were selected though they aren't revealed. But here are some of the answers. \nThe Obvious Ones \n\nMany (but not all) of the Python books have snakes, Rust has a crab, OCaml has a Camel, GNU has a gnu. \nOracle Bugs \n\n\"Oracle Essentials\" has a cicada, \"Oracle Regular Expressions\" have spiders, \"Oracle 8i Internal Services\" has a bumblebee, dragonfly, dung beetle, lady bug, lantern fly, leaf insect, ants, praying mantis, etc. Very consistently bugs. The speculation is often \"oracle software bad\" but its likely just a meaningless theme (with each animal having a deep meaning) and not meant to piss off Oracle. It is special as even Python is not consistently snakes, and other groups of books like Google, Regular Expressions, Javascript, etc, do not have any themes. \nPerl Camel \n\nHere's a weird one, as the obvious choice would be an oyster for the pearl. Wall Street Journal claims that Larry Wall, creator of the language, wanted a camel because like Perl it's ugly but can go a long way without water. Some also claim it's a reference to the proverb \"a camel is a horse designed by a committee\" and how Perl is easily identifiable as a mixture of other languages. It's cool as the camel as adopted as Perl's mascot after the O'Reilly book. \nPython (entirely my conspiracy) \n\nNot all of the Python books have snakes! \"Data Wrangling with Python\" has a lizard, which seems to be a reference to giving Python \"legs\" to work with data. \"Python Programming On Win32\" is a crocdile, which to me just screams \"PYTHON BUT MAKE IT SCARY\". \"Learning Python\" is a rat and \"Python Coobook\" is a rabbit, which may be a reference to them being more introductory Python books as they're snake food. \nMacOS Powder Explosion Wallpaper \n\nMacOS has always had some iconic wallpapers, especially of California views so this one stood out to me as \"this should be generated\". This isn't related to programming but I thought I'd investigate it since I've always wanted to know. \n\nApple explicitly scrubs EXIF data, which is all that microchip tracking metadata that are automatically attached to your images for location, time, device, shutter speeds, etc. The one time the EXIF was leaked on one image it had a bunch of nitpicking notes like \"fill in this area close to the edge with more tree so it doesn’t create awkward negative shapes\" and \"darken some of the stars that are a bit smaller and darker, so there is a little more difference in the starfield\" which I guess could be expected for the quality of the Apple wallpapers and the anxiety that comes with being the photographer for a MacOS wallpaper. \nSpoiler alert, I didn't actually figure out if these were generated or photographed, but I did figure out how one would generate/photograph them, and that they are very probably photographed. Here is the precedence: photographed ethereal Apple productions. \n\nHow to Photograph \n\nAs expected, making these powder explosions would be a pain. One must first have the space, the high speed camera (powder flying through the air like that lasts less than a second) and cover all of the equipment. The powder is typically flour, and mixed with \"holi\" powder which is just high pigment powder for photoshoots/parties/crafts. It seems that many photographers actually have people in suits to throw the powder and those shots tend to look more like powder clouds than explosions. I found someone who did something a bit more clever, which involves a simple canon mechanism (silicon tubing and a pump) and sound triggered. \nHow to Render \n\n3D animation software of course would also enable you to do this, and in my opinion produces better results. \nThe general approach is to start with a sphere, create some noise outwards like a spiky ball. Turn those vectors into dots going out, then configure those dots to create more particles in the direction of the velocity. Wind and air drag simulations are built into most animation software. \nEnd \n\nPlease send me more lore at hello@carolchen.me \nHave a nice day &lt;3 \n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/tech/iconic-computer-science-images/","title":"Iconic Images Programmers Happen to Know"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/tech/no-not-good-enough/":{"body":"This is a pro-not-going-to-college post in the context of people around the tech industry. It is mostly for people who are entertaining no-college as something that might be good for them. It is not about why or if dropping out is a good idea, and more to air out the idea that not going to school requires some level of skill -- a notion probably brought forth by prolific dropouts. \nMost messaging with not going to school along the lines of \"there are more important things to work on\", \"you can learn faster outside of school\", \"why wait for a degree when you can start working now\", or \"you could be running a kickass startup instead\". All of these are great reasons to not go to school, but they have an implication that you have to be skilled to a certain degree (haha, \"degree\"). Good enough to have the opportunities to work on more important things. Good enough that school isn't already challenging your learning. Good enough to get a job. Good enough to run a startup. \nMost of my conversations with people who are interested in the concept of not going to school have implied that not being good enough is a blocker. Of course, there are other overlapping blockers related to fear, money, privilege, or it simply not being a good choice for your priorities, but I think \"not being good enough\" is wholy surmountable (provided you're accurately evaluating your own abilities). \nDoing the things no one else has had the chance to do \n\nI model ambition/excellence as a spectrum. One end is \"getting ahead\" and the other end is \"getting a bonus\". Canonical \"getting ahead\" would be graduating early, getting promoted quickly and rising to the top of your org in record time. It's hard to describe what \"getting a bonus\" might be like since it's by nature dependent on things one might not expect to have done. It can be summarized as \"doing the things no one else has had the chance to do\". \nThis is a wavy spectrum, and the range shrinks and ambiguities increase when you apply it to any individual. Regardless, I contend that \"getting a bonus mentality\" helps make it such that one can't be \"not good enough\" to skip college. \nWhile they're two ends of a spectrum, I think few would argue that both approaches can lead to excellence, success, ambition, or whatever it is you want for yourself. However, with \"getting a bonus\", there is much less \"not good enough\" barrier. Instead of getting a job at Google after dropping out, you can work on a side project, take the time to pursue another career path, work at a non-profit or train to climb Mount Everest.\nIn my first year not going to school, I learned to juggle, taught programming bootcamp and suprised myself by moving to a \"city\" with less than a million people for my first experience living away from home. The time I saved allowed me to further pursue an interests in the arts I found too late because I was obsessed with getting internships in high school and gave me flexibility to travel. With the money I saved (and employment) I was able to donate over 25% of my pretax income. \nDoing the things no one else has the chance to do is easier when outside of school, since you have increased flexibility and range to seek opportunities. Furthermore, this kind of excellence and achievement scales. If you buy that the difficulty to improve at something becomes exponentially harder, then you should gain more valuable experiences and skills by doing a variety of offbeat things. I don't want this to slip into a jack-of-all-trades-is-the-best-skillset career recommendation. This scalability does apply to your career skills, but it also applies to the values of your experiences, for all axes of \"values\". \nFalling behind \n\nIf \"getting a bonus\" is the opposite of \"getting ahead\", then certainly that means you fall behind right? Perhaps! But you will have earned four years of doing things that no one else will have had. Given tech, you won't be a full-four years behind in your career, though it's possible you won't be as well off as you would be if you had gone to school. Additionally, I think that not being in school often helps accelerate your \"goodness\", though that's a separate \"why get out of school\" post. \nNot going to college definitely put me behind in a lot of things. When working on TruffleRuby at Shopify I got burned by not having taking an Operating Systems or Concurrency course. Not having a degree puts me in a very difficult spot in immigrating anywhere (I'm stuck in Canada). It takes out the character I would have built struggling through courseloads (I was not good at high school, I probably would not have been that much better at college and it's unfortunate I may never be able to correct that). It certainly cuts down some my job opportunities. \nSo yeah, falling behind is a thing. One path is to just accept it with the other less-measurable experiences you have achieved, another is to convince yourself that it's not quite as real as one might think. \nOnce you get out of school, the different axis on which you can succeed grows quickly. Some may end up caring only about their salary, others on their social lives, others on their ability to start a family. It gets drastically harder to compare who is more successful, if you were even worried about that in the first place. The farther I get away from the school-scene the more apparent it is that I am not behind on valuable experiences.\n\nIf you are interested in not going to school, then the much harder question is what on earth to do. I don't have many coherent thoughts about this that is suitable as general advice, but if you want to email me at hello@carolchen.me we can chat~\n&lt;3, \nKipply\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/tech/no-not-good-enough/","title":"You can't be \"not good enough\" to skip (or drop out of) college"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/tech/past-webdev/":{"body":"A majority of programmers work in the massive field of web development, because there are so many jobs, resources and problems to solve! This is especially true for self-taught developers like myself or bootcamp grads. With that, there are also many people looking to try something other than web-development, whether it be out of boredom, curiousity or passion for another area of computer science.\nI'm particularly a fan of this, as while web-development got me hooked into programming (and is partially what I do now), exploring other types of work made me a much much better engineer. I think that two months of working on backend development at Shopify helped me grow less than a three-month side project for which I built a very simple raytracer. My experience has also been that it's very hard to break out of web development since there's activation energy, and it's harder to be as impactful, so I'm hoping this will help.\nProjects \n\nProjects listed in vague order of increasing difficulty / time committment. I have not done all these of course, but I at least know someone who did / have some special respect for the creator.\nRay Tracing In One Weekend \n\nLink to Book\nThis is one of the single most impactful projects I've done! With a raytracer you can model objects in 3D space and generate images for what they'd look like by applying your own colours, angles and lightning. It uses a little bit of math and teaches introductory graphics. The most fun part about raytracing is the development cycle, since you can instantly test software (limited by how fast your computer is) and see the result, without having to worry about hidden bugs.\nI estimate for it to take less than a week if you work on it full time and a month if doing it in free time. There is also \"Ray Tracing the Next Week\" and \"Ray Tracing the Rest of Your Life\" if you want more!\nLLVM Tutorial \n\nLink to Tutorial\nThe LLVM tutorial helps you to build an entire programming language with LLVM which is insanely fun and relevant to software we use everyday. It also includes teachings about JITs! I recommend not following the OCaml tutorials as the tutorials are old and you'll have trouble installing dependencies (like I did). I really like compilers as an area of focus because unlike graphics or GPU programming, your work is relevant to anyone who is a programmer.\nI estimate this to take a week full time and 2+ weeks doing it in free time and no more than two months.\nCrafting Interpreters \n\nLink to Book\nI put this one after the LLVM tutorial just because it is longer, but Crafting Interpreters is an excellent resource. It actually teaches you how to build two interpreters, one with Java and another with C and also covers VMs and garbage collection. I think the type of interpreters you'll build through Crafting Interpreters will help you understand CRuby and CPython source code more than the LLVM Tutorial will help you understand Rust source code.\nI recommend starting on the second interpreter iff you have a solid impression of how interpreters tend to work and you're familiar with programming in C as well as data structures. I estimate the entirety of Crafting Interpreters to take 3 - 6 weeks full time or a few months part time (more variable since it's longer and there are more opportunities to challenge yourself).\nSpinning Up in Deep Reinforcement Learning \n\nLink to Resource\nThis collection of resources / docs is created by Open AI and generally impressed me in quality of documentation (I generally have very little faith in big companies being able to document things well). It's not a tutorial, but is good at giving the full picture (how to get into the career, lingo, example implementations, etc). It also provides two exercises that are fairly long as well as fun information such as PyTorch vs Tensorflow comparisons.\nI think of all the resources I listed, this one gets you the closest to a career change (partially just the nature of the ML field). I only list one Machine Learning related resource because other good intro-to-ML guides have good page rank (though I think Spinning Up in Deep RL has underrated pagerank). \nSome resources for people who already have some background in AI (read the Wikipedia definitions and did Tensorflow/Pytorch tutorials): \n\nDeep Dive into Machine Learning (a book)\nFor people vaguely familiar with Machine Learning: (language model focused, sorry)\n\nAll You Need is Attention (a paper)\nBERT (a paper, though BERT is not the entire name of the paper)\nGPT2 (also a paper, and GPT2 is not the name of the paper)\n\n\nCollection of Resources about AI Safety (doesn't actually need much of a ML background)\n\nImplementing the Raft Distributed Consensus System \n\nLink to Raft Info Page\nRaft is a consensus algorithm. I'm not going to describe further, but it's an algorithm to solve problems with distributed systems -- something you may be familiar with! Unlike many of the projects I've listed, Raft will require a lot of reading / research to build background knowledge. Implementing Raft requires knowledge about operating systems, systems programming in general, networks and concurrency. I feel that it'll also test more software engineering skills since the process will include lots of logging, tests and error handling.\nI'm not going to give time estimates about Raft since I've read a lot but haven't implemented it. More importantly, it depends on your background. If I had to say, it would be at least a week full time.\nBuilding an Operating System \n\nThis one seems fun but I've only briefly attempted it.\nJulia Evans on an OS in Rust | Georgia Tech Course Materials | OS Tutorial (unmaintained in 2+ years) | OS Dev Wiki\nThough challenging and a long project, I recommend OS dev because it's a surprisingly common project (you can probably find more resources for this than say, Raft). The difficult parts with this project is that it's more open-ended, longer even to get to a minimal project and the development cycle is a bit more painful.\nEstimate 4+ weeks full time for a minimal-ish OS.\nMiscellaneous \n\nComputer Vision. I didn't list any tutorials for this since none are particularly special, but OpenCV is powerful and there are a whole bunch of projects that can come out of it! The documentation is not as polished as most web-dev documentation which I think makes it extra fun.\nBlockchain. I'm generally pretty clueless about blockchain, so not listing any resources but I'm leaving it here in case anyone has ideas.\nRegex. This is not a career, nor is it distinct from webdev, but it certainly exercises your brain in a different way and is a unique skill! Being able to write regexes off the top of my head has been a great help to my software engineering. I learned/practiced through Regex Crosswords.\nActivities and References \n\nCompetitive Programming \n\nHesistant about including this since it's sometimes just \"leetcoding\" but I think competitive programming was formative to my programming skills. Codeforces has weekly contests (also see TopCoder, DMOJ). Some of the problems are more traditional data science and algorithms, but sites like Codeforces over Leetcode will have some more adhoc and math focused puzzles. Speaking of math, Project Euler is also a great source of problems. I also like throwing away writing good code sometimes and just writing code for me!\nKaggle for Data Science and Machine Learning \n\nKaggle is a platform where users receive datasets and try to predict / compute some values in a contest format. They also have some open datasets with various tutorials on how to work with them, such as the Titanic Dataset.\nGeneral Things \n\nBegone Stack Overflow, Hello Papers \n\nAs a web developer, a lot of my learning was throug Stack Overflow, videos and Medium articles. I think my learning of compilers was high-friction because of my unwillingness to read papers (which I'm still working on). This is not applicable to everything, for example machine learning has a lot of strong Stack Overflow resources through uses of libraries (though you'll definitely need to read papers for ML), and for learning to do reverse engineering, individual blog posts with write-ups are probably your best resource. In general, you may have to relearn how you filter / search through content.\nOpen Source \n\nSomething missing from this article is \"after I learn these skills, how do I get a job?\", and the reason it's missing is because I'd be talking out of my ass if I tried to answer that. However, I do some know reliable ways through which that has been done and Open Source is definitely one of them!\nSpend some time looking into different projects and start working up towards contributions. I recommend larger projects for exposure and also because they'll have better support systems for new contributors. I know numerous people who somewhat bypassed education through side projects and gained skills entirely through working on OSS!\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/tech/past-webdev/","title":"Ideas for Programmers Looking Beyond Web Development"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/tech/real-good-things-about-internships/":{"body":"I mainly wrote this blog post to help advertise Shopify as a great place to intern at, but I'm sure all of these aspects can be found at other great companies, though maybe not all at one company/team. I recommend this blog post not only for those looking to apply to Shopify, but to know how great internships can be and what qualities you would want from an internship. \nI'm currently writing this in my last week at Shopify as I have decided to go elsewhere full-time, though I still love Shopify enough that I chose to intern there over joining a YCombinator cohort! It is a very special place to be, which is also why I returned three times (started interning at Shopify in Summer 2018). \nflexibility \n\nThis is an underlying factor in a lot of other things I'll talk about, but I like that Shopify doesn't often have \"rules\" for anything. Shopify let me do two (two month) internships to accommodate for my two-month summers. They also let me work part-time after I graduated! Most importantly, they don't require interns to be enrolled in a bachelor's degree program bringing epic diversity to intern classes from people with degrees in other fields or former chefs. I got the same epic flexibility at Hatch Canada, working part-time and being allowed to work on projects of my choosing.\nroom to do all the learning \n\nI'd say I'm three times better of a programmer than I was when I started at Shopify. It happen partially through the classic \"learning on the job\". By building applications and getting code reviews from coworkers I became a better programmer. However, I think the key that made learning on the job effective was being able to ask a shitload of questions. Shopify was good at building an environment where I felt I could do that without feeling like I was asking bad questions or bothering anyone. This let me spend less time confused, make better decisions, learn about things I could apply in the future (or just sate curiosity).\nAnother great thing is that I had the room to dedicate time to learning. That included working through a book, reading papers or attending conferences. Shopify funded me buying textbooks and I felt alright taking a day to read up on a subject. I often spent time going down rabbit holes of reading even after completing a task. I was approved to go to Japan for a conference (cancelled due to COVID-19) and spent a day attending a workshop on VMs (didn't even bother getting approval for that).\nLearning is good. Especially in internships, your focus should be investing in yourself and great companies should want to invest in you (within reason of course).\nimpact \n\nA lot of companies end up giving interns a special project of sorts. While the project may be substantial, interesting and potentially impactful, they often get iced as soon as the intern leaves. This may not be valuable to everyone, but at Shopify I was apart of the weekly sprints and worked on producing features and fixes that other engineers were actually relying on. Not having intern projects would also help you better understand how much you'd enjoy working at a company full-time. The downside of course, is that you might not actually have anything to call \"your own\" and you will lose engineering time to things like planning meetings (which are important and fun too!). But then... the next section.\nbeing a champion \n\nFor my third internship at Shopify, I switched from the Facebook team to a neighbouring team with people I had worked with in the past (so it was still fairly familiar). It was a bit weird, as for those four months I'd be working part-time at 20 hours a week. This would make it hard for me to be involved in day-to-day work, especially with it being Black Friday Cyber Monday (huge week for Shopify). So, I went on to champion my own project where I extended an open source app into being able to generate code (Rails and NodeJS) to build Marketing Activity extensions. This meant that I was the lead on the project, and was responsible for informing stakeholders on the status. I interacted with numerous teams and became the \"person to go to\" for information on the project. Yes, there was a risk of it ending up more like an intern project, but that's why it was also apart of the job to communicate with other teams and do health checks to make sure the project was ontrack and useful. Though it was not a huge project, it was exciting, impactful and \"my own\"!\ncompany exposure beyond where you're working \n\nMy first four months at Shopify were on the Facebook Ads / Instagram Checkout team, where we worked on an application for Shopify merchants to be able to directly advertise on Facebook through Shopify and to sell products via Instagram. Throughout my time there, I not only worked with the Facebook API but was in contact with Facebook engineers about goals and for technical support. The Facebook team also flew in to work with us and have social events, which was pretty fun! These experiences were unique, and helped me exercise some remote-working communication skills (which are really being tested during this quarantine).\nwriting for an engineering blog \n\nAt the beginning of my current internship, I wrote a blog post about the first PR I shipped. The Engineering Blog doesn't have any special barrier for interns submitting work - if you did something cool, you can write about it! Through writing the post, I was able to talk to some cool folks on the Eng Comms team and sharpen my shoddy writing skills. My post now lives on Shopify Engineering Blog! It was great exposure for a personal brand to, as the post made it to the top post of Hacker News and stayed on the front page for over twelve hours.\npeople who really care \n\nThis is the aspect I think Shopify is likely most special for, and the reason I was most afraid to leave Shopify. I always felt like my team members and lead had my best interests, and wanted to make sure that I felt productive and happy at Shopify. Weekly 1:1s, frequent kind words and so many other things really brought this together. Our CTO reached out to me to compliment me for my blog post. When the company went remote due to COVID-19, I got a personal message from my Director making sure that I was doing alright (which was ridiculous because he was dealing with being quarantined with kids) along with a little casual chat. Shopify didn't even let go of culinary workers when we went remote. The list could go on! Choosing to leaving Shopify was a really emotional experience (I cried when verbally turning down the offer) because of all the kindness, patience and care people there have offered me.\n\nSo keep an eye out for Shopify internships postings, and go do internships in general! Internships at Shopify run three times a year (January, May, September) for 4 to 8 months. Applications open 4 months before start dates~\nFeel free to email me (hello@carolchen.me) with any questions about choosing internships, or questions about working at Shopify or anything! Courage to talk to strangers on the internet will earn you my respect &lt;3. However, please try to avoid questions along the lines of \"how do I get an internship?\" as quite frankly I don't have insight beyond knowing exactly what I did (some of which I have forgotten). Requests for resume reviews, for example, is something I could actually help out with.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/tech/real-good-things-about-internships/","title":"Working At Shopify Is Great"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/technical/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/technical/","title":""},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/technical/chemical-composition-of-apple-screens/":{"body":"In July of 2017, nine SHAD Fellows participated in a fast-paced version of the Students on the Beamline program at the University of Saskatchewan. Other than flat ground(and more flat ground), Saskatchewan is home to a synchrotron light source, the only one in Canada and one of eight in North America.\nA synchrotron particle accelerator uses about 900 billion electrons at any point in time, sped up to around 1.38×10⁹ km/hr - fast enough to reach the moon in a second. As these electrons spin, certain laws of physics allow them to produce extremely powerful light. The light produced at the synchrotron is millions of times brighter than the sun.\nAt the CLS, our team decided to investigate the strength of glass based on it's chemical composition. Because of the busy program, we had twenty hours over two weeks to come up with an idea, research, gather samples and analyze the data. We wouldn't have gotten anything done without large amount of donations, including:\n\niPod Touch 4\niPhone 4\niPhone 5\niPhone 5c\niPhone 6\niPhone 6s\nAnd many other non-Apple devices. Many of the Android devices used Gorilla Glass, and given how notorious Apple is for planned obsolescence.\n\nSpoiler alert: Since the iPod Touch 4, the quality of glass from these devices has been increasing. Apple does not use cheaply produced glass hoping that people visit their expensive repair shops more often.\nAnywho, really bright lights are cool. X-Rays are essential for doctors, and your desk light helps you to read through the night. Synchrotrons aim lights at samples to gather information about chemical composition, map where elements are found and model the molecular structure of samples.\nDuring our experiment we worked with the XRF technique - X-Ray Fluorescence. The high energy rays of light strike the atoms in the sample, exciting the electrons. Electrons from lower energy orbitals (for example, an electron from n = 2) will be dislodged from the atom, causing an electron from a higher energy orbital to fall into it's place. This will release a very specific amount of energy, which when measured can be used to identify the element. Add a few asterisks to the information you just read, cause it's physics and it's not really that straightforward.\n\nGorilla Glass tells us that they use an ion-exchange process to add potassium ions to their glass, with the theory that larger ions will cause the glass to be stronger. Sodium ions are replaced by larger potassium ions, creating compressive stress in the glass, and thus more resistant to damage.\nHere's what we found in our samples;\n\nThis graph may be a pain to read :p\nWith the XRF technique, we were able to determine relative compositions. Each peak represents the presence of a different element (as labeled). As a quick note, we still have no clue what was up with the halfnium in the iPhone 5. iPhones seem to have increasingly more potassium(K) over time, though the iPhone 6s appears to be an anomaly, though can be ignored since the phone we used was severely cracked and a powdered glass sample was used.\nIn case you're curious, unlabeled peaks are secondary peaks of an element. Depending on the electron that is dislodged, different energies will be released. Arsenic(As) is commonly used in glass production, and is expected to be present in glass. The argon peak at the beginning is just from the air.\n\nThe iPhone 5C was a cheap and very popular phone. Without a contract, they started at $99 USD while the iPhone 5 started at $649 USD. It wasn't just the specs that caused this huge price difference - the differences in quality can be observed in the glass. The iPhone 5C had significantly less potassium(K) and more calcium(Ca). Apple was likely able to use calcium as a cheaper substitute for potassium as they're both Alkali Metals and share similar properties. The Iron(Fe) is most likely an impurity.\n\nIn this graph, you can see the amount of potassium(K) increase when the model of the iPhone is more recent. Additionally, there seems to be a big leap between their approach to getting stronger glass from the iPhone 4 to the 5 and 6 (Good job Apple!). The obvious question, is why not just stuff it with all the potassium possible? With the atomic structure of glass (and other properties), having too many large ions could actually cause bends or bumps in the glass. There's a good chance they have a research team dedicated to improving the glass on their phones.\nIt's always good to know that Apple is really trying to make our phones last longer, and they're not really hoping that you're visiting their expensive-ass Genius Bar with shattered screens.\nThanks for reading,\nCarol Chen, the rest of the team and scientists at the CLS\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/technical/chemical-composition-of-apple-screens/","title":"Chemical Composition of Apple Screens"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/technical/escape-analysis/":{"body":"With software engineering, speed and memory are the basic measurement-benchmarks. For programming language implementations, the two affect each other heavily. In JIT compilers, that means storing more things in memory to speed up the program drastically. It also means putting time into garbage collection to keep memory down, spending time to try to eliminate allocations and deciding where to put some piece of data. \nEscape Analysis is a technique that determines the behaviour of how a variable (more specifically, a pointer) is used in a certain scope, and whether it not it escapes that scope (the scope is usually a function). Escape analysis allows the program to stack allocate (here is an article on Stack vs Heap allocations) when it's determined the variable will not be used outside of the scope or in other cases, try to eliminate the allocation completely. \n\nThank You Box \n\nI'm writing this away from family during (Canadian) Thanksgiving so thank you kind and curious friends for coming to read this!\nAlso thanks to Chris Seaton who was my intern mentor back when I actually worked on compilers and taught me sooo much, and JF Bastien who showed me how to look into clang and has just been generally helpful. Props to Alberto who fixed a bug  in Go I ran into while investigating escape analysis in Go in a matter of hours after I opened an issue, and thanks to Leo White who answered my question about the lack of escape analysis in OCaml.\n\nFor a little background on how programming languages work, skim through my post A Deep Introduction to JIT Compilers: JITs are not very Just-in-time. \nHighlights \n\n\nEscaping Boxing\nAllocation Sinking\nChrome had a Security Incident because of Escape Analysis\nEscape Analysis with LLVM backed languages\nEscape Analysis in Go\nOther Compilers that do Escape Analysis\n\nPypy Escapes Boxing \n\nPypy puts a lot of work into minimizing boxing, which is done through escape analysis. Boxing is when a primitive is boxed into an object wrapper type, such as an int to Integer in Java. Object oriented language implementations often utilize boxing (sometimes called auto-boxing), including JavaScript, C#, Haskell and others! Computers natively understands types like booleans and integers, but not objects, and unfortunately many languages need to store most of their data as an object and not the primitive. For example, 314 as a constant can be stored as a primitive on the stack, but when 314.toString() is executed, 314 has to be boxed so that the method can be run on the object. Unboxing is performed to extract the value. \nBoxing and unboxing is an expensive operation, with .NET citing 20x the time for boxed assignment and 4x the time for unboxing assignment (when you explicitly cast back). Pypy also has expensive boxing operations, as it's not just assigning/computing more values but organizing them into a heap structure. \nPypy considers this to be its second most important problem, and uses \"virtual objects\", also called virtualisation. It's a fancy term that means they avoid creating the entire heap structure, store the primitive value (not on the heap) and mock any object-operations that need to happen. While the virtual object is used in some applicable scope, read and writes are done to the virtual object without the expense of boxing/unboxing. Even more computation is saved as since the virtual object exists and no guards need to exist to verify information about the value in the object, whereas guards are usually in place to check the class after loading a value. \nPypy will virtualise onto the stack optimistically and then allocate later should it become necssary. Escape analysis is really powerful in JITs mostly because jitted langauges tend to be more dynamic, but also because they can very aggressively stack allocate.  Languages that compile once have to be completely confident that the escape analysis is valid (or also compile code in case of failure) and make decisions about how far it should look to determine a scope. JITs can kind of just hope it'll work and then actually do the allocation if it doesn't -- and remember what happened for next time (though that makes it sound a lot easier than it actually is). \nFor example;\nx = 0\nfor i in range(10000):\n  # Integer.random() is not an actual stdlib operation in Python, I used it to indicate a non-primitive object is created\n  y = Integer.random() + x\n  x += y * 4 # this would also involves boxing without escape analysis, since operators are implemented as methods\nprint(x)\n\nThere are two cases of virtualisation here. The first is y, which will be virtualised as it does not escape. Thus in the second line of the loop, Pypy would no longer need a guard for the value of y. This saves us a lot more than just constructing and traversing the heap structure. When boxed, Pypy has to check the class types of y and x due to the dynamic-ness of Python -- can these values be added? If they can, where is the method to describe how they are added (Python allows operator overloading)? It also has to recreate a boxed object to reassign to y and in more complex cases could leave behind additional garbage for the GC. \nx on the other hand, does escape, but it's still valuable to virtualise it, for that allocation is in a loop and the escape is outside the loop. When a jump instruction comes in (loop ends), it’ll come with code that actually allocates x for the garbage collector and future use. Another case of escape analysis can be found in methods;\ndef foo():\n  x = {\"A\": 1, \"B\": 2}\n  return x[\"A\"]\n\nIn this case, x will likely never escape and the allocation isn't even needed to execute the rest of the function. This particular case may actually be constant-folded away (the constant is replicated at usage sites), but abstractions of this pattern will use escape analysis. Escape analysis also often takes place for language-internal operations, and I'll describe how Javascript features and internals makes escape analysis very important. \nHow Javascript Uses Escape Analysis in Language Internals \n\nThe most complex question about escape analysis (other than maybe \"how do I implement it\") is probably \"is this only beneficial to very shortlived variables, and if so how does it help much?\". As mentioned in the Pypy example, it is sometimes to protect your program from allocations that are made by the language implementation rather than the programmer. Here's a quick example in Javascript (example taken from this PDF, which has a corresponding talk that might be elementary at this point in the blog post). \nfunction bar(o) {\n  return Math.sqrt(o.x*o.x + o.y*o.y)\n}\n\nfunction foo(i) {\n  return bar({x: i, y: i})\n}\n\nOne might not expect anything to allocate even without escape analysis, but when you create the object to pass into bar it is created and allocated by default since it now exists for bar and can escape bar. This is a good example of a full allocation elimination, the allocation isn't just moved into the stack, rarther bar is inlined and then the usage of any object at all can be optimized away. \nLuaJIT Allocation Sinking \n\nIn most languages that box, essentially everything gets a box (except null and undefined types, though NaN in Javascript is boxed into a Number so terms and conditions may apply). LuaJIT is smarter off the bat and manages to not box floats and is good at not allocating (when I say \"allocate\", I mean to the heap) constants. \nLuaJIT's does something called Allocation Sinking, which is based on escape analysis and the result is very powerful allocation removals, doing things that even the age-old Hotspot can't do. Pypy implemented a vast majority of the things that LuaJIT did (see this 2012 paper) though I'd want to describe some of these optimizations in the context of LuaJIT rather than Pypy because LuaJIT gave me free examples. \nWhen data is allocated, there's typically a \"store\" and then a \"load\" later on. Store-to-load forwarding is what it sounds like, getting the subsequent \"load\" function to receive data directly from the location of storing. This is used to have powerful allocation sinking, more commonly called \"code motion\" (or specifically, loop-invariant code motion as JITs tend to be concerned with loop optimizations). These examples do not use executable Lua code. \nlocal x = 0\nfor i=1,1000 do\n  x = y + z -- i don't think this actually allocates in lua, but let’s pretend it does\n  local a = i + x\nend\n\nWhat we want is for x to be declared outside of the loop, as it saves us that allocation every time we iterate. This could be done through code motion. \nlocal x = y + z \nfor i=1,1000 do\n  a = i + x\nend\n\nIn the example below, the allocation of i to y should be moved to be inside the conditional. Note that this optimization is not quite covered by the base strategy described for Pypy.\nfor i=1,1000 do  \n  local y = i\n  if random() &gt; 0.5:  -- but does not escape this if statement\n    x = y + z\n  local a = i + x\nend\n-- should become\nfor i=1,1000 do  \n  if random() &gt; 0.5: \n    local y = i\n    x = y + z\n  local a = i + x\nend\n\nHere, LuaJIT defers the write and forwards the data to the read. As a result, the allocation and read are very much removed. The forwarding destination is the point of escape, which is where the escape analysis comes in. \nLuaJIT has an explicit mark-and-sweep pass to do sinks. For an example that highlights the allocation sinking, LuaJIT performed on par with C++ and 700x faster than Lua. Specifically (taken from the LuaJIT Blog): \nlocal ffi = require(\"ffi\")\nlocal point\npoint = ffi.metatype(\"struct { double x, y; }\", {\n  __add = function(a, b)\n   return point(a.x + b.x, a.y + b.y)\n  end\n})\nlocal a, b = point(1.5, 2.5), point(3.25, 4.75)\nfor i=1,100000000 do a = (a + b) + b end\nprint(a.x, a.y)\n\nThis example does some things that are familiar from the Pypy example -- it creates temporary objects while performing the arithmetic (point(a.x + b.x, a.y + b.y)). These two under-the-hood allocations are expensive, but LuaJIT optimizes them away! Even Hotspot fails to make this optimization. \nImportant note that LuaJIT does not describe this as escape analysis, and particularly specifies that escape analysis is not ideal for dynamic languages (because there are too many points of escape in dynamic languages), but the intention of finding points of escape and saving allocation times is the same even though the traditional \"if escape then heap_allocate else stack_allocate\" is not an accurate description of allocation sinking. \nWhere have all the interpreted languages gone \n\nThis blog post doesn't cover interpreted languages! The obvious answer is that because they're interpreted, there's no room for them to do escape analysis, and unlike JITs they can't recompile or move from interpretation to compilation. However, most interpreted languages (Python, Ruby, PHP) do have a compile step where bytecode is emitted, so there's no technical reason why escape analysis couldn't be performed at that step. These languages need to maintain fast compile times, which is the broad reason why it isn't done. Additionally, as mentioned by Mike Pall of LuaJIT, dynamic languages have too many points of escape, which is handle-able by JITs but would be harder to implement as a part of static compilation.\nSome Security Escaped V8 \n\nJavascript's V8 engine does escape analysis similarly to the way described in Pypy and LuaJIT. In 2017 though, a bug with overly aggressive escape analysis became a significant vulnerability for Chrome browsers and escape analysis was disabled for about a week before they reimplemented it. This is an Extremely Cool exploit and I'm surprised there wasn't a write-up on it. \n\nThe Chrome team marked this as \"high\" with a $7500 reward, and the bug is fairly intuitive -- something isn't allocated when it should be and errors will occur due to something not existing when it should be. The reason it's a security vulnerability is unrelated to escape analysis and requires too much background to fully explore in this post.\nBut for an entire Chrome Version, this key optimization was just... gone? I assume compiler speed in the scope of web-browsing speed is but a minor factor due to all the caching and network times, but other than that I don't actually know what to expect with escape analysis gone. It probably would've been very impactful for NodeJS, but the vulnerability had to do with the browser API so Node was not at risk. \nSo... benchmark time! I'll be running Octane, which is not a recommended benchmark suite (retired in 2017) but is pretty big and came with my build of V8. I didn't bother too much with scientific process, and ran it on my laptop for three runs (V8 recommends 10). I ran without CPU frequency scaling or limiting the number of cores though I could make an argument that I should've. \nI rebuilt V8 (I could've also tested with Chrome builds, but those seemed harder to find/built and maybe there were other performance affecting charges), based on commit history here. This compares the impact of this security patch, and not the impact we would get by disabling EA now (it got a big overhaul!). \n                               benchmark:    score |  master_ |      % |\n===================================================+==========+========+\n                                Richards:  28998.3 |  29093.8 |   -0.3 |\n                               DeltaBlue:  51902.6 S  51187.0 S    1.4 |\n                                  Crypto:  32698.2 |  33198.3 |   -1.5 |\n                                RayTrace:  54845.4 S  80116.3 |  -31.5 |\n                             EarleyBoyer:  41575.6 |  42536.7 |   -2.3 |\n                                  RegExp:   8115.0 S   8302.8 |   -2.3 |\n                                   Splay:  22830.1 S  23609.1 S   -3.3 |\n                            SplayLatency:  39286.6 S  40214.6 S   -2.3 |\n                            NavierStokes:  37347.0 |  37557.0 |   -0.6 |\n                                   PdfJS:  31527.6 |  32036.1 |   -1.6 |\n                                Mandreel:  39278.4 |  39593.9 |   -0.8 |\n                         MandreelLatency: 117204.4 S 119061.7 S   -1.6 |\n                                 Gameboy:  75636.3 S  76792.6 S   -1.5 |\n                                CodeLoad:  22562.2 S  23094.8 |   -2.3 |\n                                   Box2D:  75097.7 S  79478.3 |   -5.5 |\n                                    zlib:  65881.2 |  65934.8 |        |\n                              Typescript:  23753.4 |  23682.8 |    0.3 |\n                                  Octane:  38420.0 S  39782.1 |   -3.4 |\n---------------------------------------------------+----------+--------+\n\nFrom this we can observe that disabling escape analysis could not have been that bad for Chrome, with a 3.4% reported slowdown (though it is a significant optimization for a compiler). RayTrace is quite an outlier there, and I find it amusing since the Raytracer probably deals with a lot of objects to represent points and shapes in space, which is exactly what the example in the previous Javascript and Lua sections were doing. \nWith the new escape analysis, disabling it cost 6.3% instead of 3.4%, which indicates that the new escape analysis is better. These benchmarks are good enough to make note of the importance of escape analysis, what kind of operations it works well on but not good enough to say that \"escape analysis makes Javascript 6.3% faster\". \nEscape Analysis with LLVM-backed languages \n\nEscape analysis happens for statically compiled languages too! I'll go through an example with clang, Julia (which is jitted, but statically compiled with type information), and then touch on what happens with Rust. LLVM is a toolchain which handles code generation for many languages, and will optimize them in mostly the same way. \nHere is the C++ code I'll work with for this example. I started by running it through clang, which is a C++ (and friends) compiler with an LLVM backend. \nint foo(int a, int b, int c) {\n    int *t = new int[3]; // the new operator in cpp is conventionally an allocation, though it is implementation defined \n\n    t[0] = a;\n    t[1] = b;\n    t[2] = c;\n\n    int r = t[0]+t[1]+t[2]; // because this is the only usage of `t`, we should be able to optimize away the allocation of `t`\n    delete[] t; // the compiler has to understand that this `delete` operation doesn't require an allocation of `t` to exist\n    return r; \n}\n\nIt's easy to tell that escape analysis happens here with the emmitted assembly - we get only three instructions; lea, add and ret. lea computes an address of X and stores it in Y, add is the arithmetic (the lea does a part of the addition) and then ret is a return. The instructions for foo begin when r is intialized and assigned. gcc will not make this optimization, though this is not at all an indication that gcc is less powerful than clang. \nI would not call this escape analysis outside of a blog post though it describes a similar process of allocation elimination. This is better described as constant propogation, as the escape analysis is not really checking escape out of a loop or funciton, but that the only escape (which is reading for this case) of the values. LLVM does explicitly run escape analysis for more conventional examples shown previously though this is easier to work with as an example.\n// this is C and not C++ code but it's all `clang` anyway\n#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;\n\nvoid indirect(int *x) {\n    x[0] = 14;\n}\n\nint foo() {\n    int *x = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int)); // malloc usually means allocations\n    indirect(x);\n    int y = x[0];\n    free(x);\n    return y;\n}\n\nLLVM does it quite well, with this example getting the allocations optimized away. Both indirect and foo only has a mov instruction (copies between registers). So there are actually two cases, the first being x not being allocated and the second is y not being allocated. Nothing is allocated, though it makes sense that a simple additional function call with a pointer does not make it that much harder for LLVM (though it would make it much harder for more dynamic languages). \nTo see where these optimizations happen, we can look at the LLVM code (an intermediate representation for LLVM, higher level than assembly). I looked for a znam instruction which clang uses to make allocations. For the first example, there is only one allocation for the array t. Then with the options -mllvm -print-after-all I get some output with the LLVM code at various steps, specified such as \"value propogation\" or \"dead argument elimination\". \nAfter a run of \"Combine redundant instructions\", znam disappears, and the instructions are about halved (this is not proportionate to speed). store operations are also gone after this step, (they belong to the t[n]= {a|b|c} lines). Exploring the implementation you can also see how they explicitly look for escapes. \nBelow is the same program in Julia. Working with this optimization in Julia is more difficult because it is mostly JIT compiled, with functions compiled (statically) as they are called. Julia also has the challenge of being garbage collected. For the below, I rigged a compilation to LLVM code with @code_llvm. \nfunction foo(a, b, c)\n  t = Int64[a, b, c]\n\n  r = t[0]+t[1]+t[2]\n\n  clear!(:t) # Free! The Memory\n  r\nend\n\nThis time I'm looking for store instruction which is used to write to memory. Julia does not optimize away the creation of the array t, probably partially due a specific Julia feature or the increased complexity of LLVM code due to Julia's dynamic-ness relative to C++ (it is generally unclear to me what blocks this). Julia would probably do a better job at less convoluted constant propagation and it does do fine on escape analysis, as seen on the below example. \nfunction foo() # same example from earlier with Pypy!\n    x = 0\n    for i = 1:123\n    \ty = rand(1, 5) # if rand is not used, the entire function gets turned into a constant value return! \n    \tx += y * 4 \n    end\n    x\nend\n\nFor this, I didn't even have to look for store or anything GC related, the code is the same if I replace y * 4 with rand(1, 5) * 4. \nOther LLVM-backed languages include Swift, Crystal and Rust. If you've heard anything about Rust, it's probably something along the lines of \"yeah manual memory management is hard but Rust makes it easier\". If I worded it as \"Rust makes it very easy/automatic to statically check memory\" then I'd be closer to saying \"Rust's memory is automatically managed, just not at runtime\". If you've heard another thing about Rust it's probably \"borroooowww cheeeeckkkeeeerrr\". Look into Rust's Ownership Structure and you might find that the borrow checker basically prevents you from accidentally letting something get stuck in the heap when it escapes. I certainly would not call the borrow checker \"escape analysis\" but it's a relevant concept in Rust that is rather parallel to escape analysis. \nGo \n\nGolang Escape Analysis is the most documented between all the language implementations I described. Go doesn't use LLVM for code generation and is garbage collected. With Go, I can build with -gcflags -m (with -m multiple times for more verbosity) to see all the escape analysis decisions (I could do this for V8 as well). Go's escape analysis is very focused on \"does it escape the function\". \nI found a cool example to showcase Go Escape Analysis, pulled from this Stack Overflow question. \nfunc main() {\n  const alloc int = 65536\n  now := time.Now()\n  loop := 50000\n  for i := 0; i &lt; loop; i++ {\n    allocation := make([]byte, alloc)\n    i += len(allocation) * 0\n  }\n  elapsed := time.Since(now)\n  fmt.Println(elapsed)\n}\n\nThe number 65536 probably looks familiar to you -- it's exactly 64K. The Stack Overflow question asks why setting alloc to 65535 instead of 65536 causes this code to speed up by 10000x (by my unscientific measurements on my local machine). Turns out with the slightly larger size, Go decides that the alloc must escape to the heap. The SO answer is more or less \"this is just the GC running because escape analysis\" but we have time to get into it. Here is the debugging output with 65535 \n./alloc.go:17:14: inlining call to fmt.Println // inlining\n./alloc.go:13:15: make([]byte, alloc) does not escape // decides that `alloc does not escape scope`, correct\n./alloc.go:17:14: elapsed escapes to heap // decides `elapsed` escapes? weird. \n./alloc.go:17:14: []interface {} literal does not escape // irrelevant, related to println\n\nBefore I move onto why the alloc escapes, why does elapsed escape when it seems fairly obviously only used in main? Go will count a function call as escape, and thus printing elapsed causes it to be allocated. This is not usually too much of a problem, since inlining will occur first, but fmt.Println is complex enough that the inlined function contains another function call (this is shown when I add more -ms). My non-professional opinion is that I expected more aggressive escape analysis and inlining, but I still see no evidence that Go escape analysis has a lot of room for improvement since I don't understand Go language internals or core philosophies that might prevent more aggressive escape analysis. \nAnyway, when I set it to 65536 here is the expanded output to explain why Go thinks alloc needs to go to the heap. \n./alloc.go:13:15: make([]byte, alloc) escapes to heap:\n./alloc.go:13:15:   flow: {heap} = &amp;{storage for make([]byte, alloc)}:\n./alloc.go:13:15:     from make([]byte, alloc) (non-constant size) at ./alloc.go:13:15\n\nWhat's up with this \"non-constant size\" business? I even used the keyword const! If I manually constant propogate and don't use the alloc const, it still escapes to heap. The answer is a bug that I reported and was shockingly fixed with two reviewers in less than 24 hours and I am so impressed with the Go devs. Anyway, the correct reason is \"too large for stack\". I did a quick search for why that number is 64K, and it seems mostly OS related and maybe hardware? Open to emails explaining max sizes for stack allocated values. \nA key to stack allocation for Golang is that you have to know the lifetime of the object at compile time - which is why escape analysis is hand in hand with \"can I stack allocate this?\". There are a bunch more general rules that can be found with a quick Google search, though they're not specification guaranteed. \nOther Compilers that do Escape Analysis \n\nLisp (and dialects) do escape analysis, and a lot of the papers about escape analysis will be about Lisp and Scheme (earliest paper I could find on the subject is 1990). This means almost nothing because there are so many lisp dialects and implementations of each of them, but here is an article about Kildall's Algorithm for Escape Analysis on a Lisp Compiler. Stalin, a Scheme compiler used a lot of data-flow analysis and advertises very powerful escape analysis. \nGraalVM will of course run Escape Analysis for any Truffle language. They call it \"partial escape analysis\", which is what was described in Pypy where the allocation is delayed, or only run at the point of escape. See the paper on this. \nHotspot (Java compiler) of course also does escape analysis, though I get the impression that it's not as \"partial\" as newer JITs (this may be biased since I can find papers about newer JITs going \"haha i am better than hotspot\" but not Hotspot going \"excuse me my escape analysis is actually great\"). One could probably run some tests with JVM backed languages like Java or Scala. \nOCaml does not do escape analysis, but will do things that are more like the constant propagation I talked about with LLVM. OCaml is garbage collected, but it is very well garbage collected (omg goals) and Escape Analysis did not help much (see thread)\nlet foo p x =\n  let r = ref x in (* `r` will not be allocated *)\n  while is_not_finished !r do\n    r := do_something !r\n  done\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/technical/escape-analysis/","title":"Escape!

Though I don't always check if an optimization exists in another JIT (it's sometimes ambiguous), I'll always state explicitly if I know it’s there. \nI will also provide code examples to show where an optimization might occur, however the optimization may not necessarily occur for that code because another optimization will take precedence. There may also be some general oversimplifications, but not more than I think exists in most posts like these. \n\nTable of Contents / Highlights \n\n\nHow meta-tracing in Pypy works\nHow GraalVM languages support C extensions\nDeoptimisation\nInlining and OSR\nSeas of Nodes\nTiering JITs\n\n(Meta)Tracing \n\nLuaJIT employs a method called tracing. Pypy does meta-tracing, which involves using a system to generate tracing interpreters and JITs. Pypy and LuaJIT are not the reference implementations of Python or Lua, but projects on their own. I would describe LuaJIT as shockingly fast, and it describes itself as one of the fastest dynamic language implementations -- which I buy fully.\nTo determine when to start tracing, the interpreting loop will look for \"hot\" loops to trace (the concept of \"hot\" code is universal to JITS!). Then, the compiler will \"trace\" the loop, recording executed operations to compile well optimized machine code. In LuaJIT, the compilation is performed on the traces with an instruction-like IR that is unique to LuaJIT. \nHow Pypy Implements Tracing \n\nPypy will start tracing a function after 1619 executions, and will compile it after another 1039 executions, meaning a function has to execute around 3000 times for it to start gaining speed. These constants were carefully tuned by the Pypy team (lots of constants are tuned for compilers in general!).\nDynamic languages make it hard to optimize things away. The following code could be statically eliminated by a stricter language, as False will always be falsy. However, in Python 2, that could not have been guaranteed before runtime.\nif False:\n  print(\"FALSE\")\n\nFor any sane program, the conditional will always be false. Unfortunately, the value of False could be reassigned and thus if the statement were in a loop, it could be redefined somewhere else. For this case, Pypy would build a \"guard\". When a guard fails, the JIT will fall back to the interpreting loop. Pypy then uses another constant (200), called trace eagerness to decide whether to compile the rest of the new path till the end of the loop. That sub-path is called a bridge.\nPypy also exposes all those constants as arguments that can be tweaked at execution, along with configuration for unrolling (expanding loops) and inlining! It also exposes some hooks so we can see when things are compiled. \ndef print_compiler_info(i):\n  print(i.type)\npypyjit.set_compile_hook(print_compiler_info)\n\nfor i in range(10000):\n  if False:\n    pass\n\nprint(pypyjit.get_stats_snapshot().counters)\n\nAbove, I set up a plain python program with a compile hook to print the type of compilation made. It also prints some data at the end, where I can see the number of guards. For the above I get one compilation of a loop and 66 guards. When I replaced the if statement with just a pass under the for-loop, I was left with 59 guards.\nfor i in range(10000):\n  pass # removing the `if False` saved 7 guards!\n\nWith these two lines added to the for loop, I will get two compilations, with the new one being of type 'bridge'!\nif random.randint(1, 100) &lt; 20:\n  False = True\nWait, but you said Meta-tracing! \n\nThe concept behind meta-tracing is “write an interpreter, get a compiler for free!” or more magically, “turn your interpreter into a JIT-compiler!”. This is just obviously a great thing, since writing compilers is hard so if we can get a great compiler for free that’s just a good deal. Pypy \"has\" an interpreter and a compiler, but there’s no explicit implementation of a traditional compiler.\nPypy has a toolchain called RPython (which was built for Pypy). It is a framework program for implementing interpreters. It is a language in that it specifies a subset of the Python language, namely to force things like static typing. It is a language to write an interpreter in. It is not a language to code in typed-Python, since it doesn’t care or have things like standard libraries or packages. Any RPython program is a valid Python program. RPython programs are transpiled to C and then compiled. Thus, the RPython meta-compiler exists as a compiled C program.\nThe “meta” in meta-tracing comes from the fact that the trace is on the execution of the interpreter rather than the execution of the program. The interpreter more or less behaves as any interpreter, with the added capability of tracing its own operations, and being engineered to optimize those traces by updating the path of the interpreter (itself). With further tracing, the path that the interpreter takes becomes more optimized. With a very optimized interpreter taking a specific, optimized path, the compiled machine code being used in that path from the compiled RPython can be used as the compilation. \nIn short, the “compiler” in Pypy is compiling your interpreter, which is why Pypy is sometimes referred to as a meta-compiler. The compiler is less for the program you're trying to execute, but rather for compiling the trace of the optimizing interpreter!\nMetatracing might be confusing, so I wrote a very bad metatracing program that can only understand a = 0 and a++to illustrate.\n# interpreter written with RPython\nfor line in code:\n  if line == \"a = 0\":\n    alloc(a, 0)\n  elif line == \"a++\":\n    guard(a, \"is_int\") # notice how in Python, the type is unknown, but after being interpreted by RPython, the type is known\n    guard(a, \"&gt; 0\")\n    int_add(a, 1)\n\nIf I ran the following in a hot loop;\na = 0\na++\na++\n\nThen the traces may look something like:\n# Trace from numerous logs of the hot loop\na = alloc(0) # guards can go away\na = int_add(a, 1)\na = int_add(a, 2)\n\n# optimize trace to be compiled\na = alloc(2) # the section of code that executes this trace _is_ the compiled code\n\nBut the compiler isn't some special standalone unit, it's built into the interpreter! So the interpreter loop would actually look something like this\nfor line in code:\n  if traces.is_compiled(line):\n    run_compiled(traces.compiled(line))\n    continue\n  elif traces.is_optimized(line):\n    compile(traces.optimized(line))\n    continue\n  elif line == \"a = 0\"\n  # ....\nAn Introduction to JVMs \n\nDisclaimer: I worked on/with a Graal-based language, TruffleRuby for four months and loved it.\nHotspot (named after looking for hot spots) is the VM that ships with standard installations of Java, and there are actually multiple compilers in it for a tiered strategy. Hotspot is open source, with 250,000 lines of code which contains the compilers, and three garbage collectors. It does an awesome job at being a good JIT, there are some benchmarks that have Hotspot on par with C++ impls (oh my gosh so many asterisks on this, you can Google to find all the debate). Though Hotspot is not a tracing JIT, it employs a similar approach of having an interpreter, profiling and then compiling. There is not a specific name for what Hotspot does, though the closest categorization would probably be a method-based JIT (they optimized by method) or a Tiering JIT. \nStrategies used in Hotspot inspired many of the subsequent JITs, the structure of language VMs and especially the development of Javascript engines. It also created a wave of JVM languages such as Scala, Kotlin, JRuby or Jython. JRuby and Jython are fun implementations of Ruby and Python that compile the source code down to the JVM bytecode and then have Hotspot execute it. These projects have been relatively successful at speeding up languages like Python and Ruby (Ruby more so than Python) without having to implement an entire toolchain like Pypy did. Hotspot is also unique in that it's a JIT for a less dynamic language (though it's technically it's a JIT for JVM bytecode and not Java). \n\nGraalVM is a JavaVM and then some, written in Java. It can run any JVM language (Java, Scala, Kotlin, etc). It also supports a Native Image, to allow AOT compiled code through something called Substrate VM. Twitter runs a significant portion of their Scala services with Graal, so it must be pretty good, and better than the JVM in some ways despite being written in Java. \nBut wait, there's more! GraalVM also provides Truffle, a framework for implementing languages through building Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) interpreters. With Truffle, there’s no explicit step where JVM bytecode is created as with a conventional JVM language, rather Truffle will just use the interpreter and communicate with Graal to create machine code directly with profiling and a technique called partial evaluation. Partial evaluation is out of scope for this blog post, tl;dr it follows metatracing’s “write an interpreter, get a compiler for free” philosophy but is approached differently.\n\nTruffleJS, the Truffle implementation of Javascript outperforms the JavaScript V8 engine on select benchmarks which is really impressive since V8 has had numerous more years of development, Google money+resources poured in and some crazy skilled people working on it. TruffleJS is still by no means “better” than V8 (or other JS engines) on most measures but it is a sign of promise for Graal. \n\nThe Unexpectedly Great JIT Compiler Strategies \n\nInterpreting C \n\nA common problem with JIT implementations is support for C Extensions. Standard interpreters such as Lua, Python, Ruby, and PHP have a C API, which allows users to build packages in C, thus making the execution significantly faster. Common packages such as numpy or standard library functions such as rand are written in C. These C extensions are vital to having these interpreted languages run quickly in practice.\nC extension support is hard to support for a variety of reasons, the most obvious being that the API is modelled on internal implementation details. Furthermore, it's easier to support C extensions when the interpreter is written in C as JRuby couldn't support C extensions but has a Java extension API. Pypy recently came out with beta support for C extensions, though I'm not sure how usable it is yet largely due to Hyrum's Law. LuaJIT does support C extensions, along with additional features in their C extensions (LuaJIT is pretty darn great!)\nGraal solves the problem with Sulong, an engine that runs LLVM Bitcode on GraalVM by making LLVM Bitcode a Truffle language. LLVM is a toolchain, though all we need to know about it is that C can be compiled into LLVM Bitcode (Julia also has an LLVM backend!). It's a bit weird, but basically the solution is to take a perfectly good 40+ year old compiled language and interpret it! Of course, it's not nearly as fast as properly compiling C, but there are a few wins tucked away in here.\n\nLLVM Bitcode is already fairly low-level, which means that jitting that IR is not as inefficient as jitting C. Some of that cost is earned back in that the Bitcode can be optimized along with the rest of the Ruby program, whereas a compiled C program could not be. All that allocation removal, inlining, dead code elimination, etc can be run on the C and Ruby code together instead of Ruby code just calling a C binary. Select benchmarks even have TruffleRuby C extensions running faster than CRuby C extensions.\nFor this system to work, it should be known that the Truffle ASTs are completely language-agnostic and the overhead to switching between C, Java or whatever language in Graal is minimal.\nThe ability for Graal to work with Sulong is a part of their polyglot features, which provides high interoperability between languages. Not only is it great for the compiler, but it is also a proof of concept for multiple languages easily used in one \"application\".\nGo back to the interpreted code, it'll be faster \n\nWe know that JITs come with an interpreter and a compiler, and that they move from the interpreter to the compiler to get faster. Pypy set bridges to take the inverse path, though for Graal and Hotspot, they deoptimize. The terms do not refer to strictly different concepts, but deoptimization refers more to transferring back to the interpreter as a deliberate optimization rather than as a solution to the inevitabilities of dynamic languages. Hotspot and Graal both leverage deoptimization aggressively -- Graal especially as engineers have heavy control over the compilation and need more control over the compilation for optimizations (compared to, say, Pypy). Deoptimization is also used in JS Engines such as V8 which I'll discuss a lot as it powers Javascript in Chrome as well as Node.js.\nAn important component to making deoptimization fast, is to make sure that switch from the compiler to interpreter is as fast as possible. The most naive implementation would result in the interpreter having to “catch up” with the compiler in order to be able to make the deopt. Additional complexity exists in dealing with deoptimizing asynchronous threads. To deoptimize, Graal will recreate the stack frames and use a mapping from generated code to return to the interpreter. For threads, safepoints in Java threads are used which are in place for threads to constantly pause and go “hi garbage collector, do I stop now?” so not much overhead is added to handle threads. It’s a bit rocky, but fast enough to make deoptimization a good strategy.\n\nSimilarly to the Pypy bridging example, monkey patching of functions can be deoptimized. The deoptimization there is actually more elegant, as it's not a deoptimization that occurs when a guard fails, rather the deoptimizing-code is added where monkey patching occurs.\nA great example of a JIT deoptimization is conversion overflow, which is not a super official term, but generally refers to when a particular type (say int32) is represented/allocated internally but needs to become a int64. This is something that TruffleRuby does through deoptimizations, as well as V8.\nSay when you set var = 0 in Ruby, you get an int32 (Ruby actually calls it Fixnum and Bignum, but I’ll continue saying int32 and int64). Whenever you perform an operation on var, you would then have to check if the resulting value overflows. The check is one thing, however, compiling the code that handles the overflow is expensive, especially given how common numeric operations are.\nEven without looking at compiled instructions, we can see how this deoptimization eases the amount of code it takes to handle.\nint a, b;\nint sum = a + b;\nif (overflowed) {\n  long bigSum = a + b;\n  return bigSum;\n} else {\n  return sum;\n}\n\nint a, b;\nint sum = a + b;\nif (overflowed) {\n  Deoptimize!\n}\n\nFor TruffleRuby, it’s engineered to only deoptimize the first time a specific operation is run, so that the cost of the deopt isn’t spent every time should an operation consistently overflow.\nWet code is fast code - Inlining and OSR \n\nfunction foo(a, b) {\n return a + b;\n}\nfor (var i = 0; i &lt; 1000000; i++) {\n foo(i, i + 1);\n}\nfoo(1, 2);\n\nIn V8, even something as trivial as that triggers a deopt! With options like--trace-deopt and --trace-opt one can gather a lot of data about the JIT as well as modify behaivour (there are also highly comprehensive tools for Graal, though I’ll be using V8 since people likely have node it installed).\nIt is the final line (foo(1, 2)) that triggers the deopt, which is puzzling because that exact call is made in the loop! The message is “Insufficient type feedback for call” (you can find a full list of deopt reasons here, which funnily includes a “no reason” reason). The output gives us an input frame which shows us the literals 1 and 2.\nSo why the deoptimization? V8 should be smart enough to type inference that the type of i is an integer and that the literals passed in are also integers.\nI can investigate this by replacing the final line with foo(i, i +1), but I actually still get a deoptimization, though this time the message is “Insufficient type feedback for binary operation”. WHY I ASK WHY IT IS LITERALLY THE SAME OPERATION I RAN IN THE LOOP WITH THE SAME VARIABLES.\nThe answer my friend, is blowing in the wind on-stack replacement (OSR). Inlining is a powerful compiler optimization (not just JITs) in which functions stop being functions and instead the contents are expanded at the call site. JITs can inline by changing the code at runtime to make it faster(compiled languages just inline statically).\n// partial output from printing inlining details\n\n[compiling method 0x04a0439f3751 &lt;JSFunction (sfi = 0x4a06ab56121)&gt; using TurboFan OSR]\n0x04a06ab561e9 &lt;SharedFunctionInfo foo&gt;: IsInlineable? true\nInlining small function(s) at call site #49:JSCall\n\nSo V8 will compile foo and determine it is inline-able and inlines it with  with OSR. However, it only performs this inlining for the code within the loop because it's the hot path and the last line doesn't really exist to the interpreter when this inlining is performed. Thus, V8 still does not have enough type feedback on the function foo because it isn’t actually used in the loop -- the inlined version is. If I --no-use-osr, then the deoptimization doesn’t happen - whether or not I pass a literal or i. Yet without the inlining even a measly million iterations are noticeably slower. JITs really embody \"there are no solutions, only tradeoffs\". Deoptimizations are expensive but not nearly as much as the cost of method lookup and inlining is much preferred in this case.\nInlining is crazy effective! I ran the code above with a couple extra zeroes, and it was 4 times slower with inlining disabled.\n\nThough this is a blog post about JITs, inlining is also really effective for compiled languages. All LLVM languages will inline aggressively (because LLVM will inline), though Julia actually inlines without LLVM because of its jitty nature. JITs can inline with heuristics that come from runtime information, and can switch from not-inlining to inlining with OSR.\n\nA note about JITs and the LLVM \n\nA toolchain to consider is LLVM, which provides a ton of tools related to compiler infrastructure. Julia works with LLVM (note that it’s a large toolchain and each language will utilize it differently), as well as Rust, Swift and Crystal. Suffice it to say that it’s a significant and amazing project that of course also supports JITs, yet there hasn’t really been any significant dynamic JITs built with the LLVM. JavaScriptCore’s fourth compiler tier briefly used an LLVM backend but was replaced in less than two years. The LLVM hasn’t been well suited to dynamic JITs generally because it wasn’t made to work with the unique challenges of being dynamic. Pypy has tried about 5 or 6 times, but JSC actually went with it! With the LLVM, allocation sinking and code motion were limited. Powerful JIT features like range-inferencing (like type inference, but also knowing the range of a value) were not possible. Most importantly, LLVM comes with very expensive compile times.\n\nWhat if instead of instruction based IR like everyone else we had a big graph, and also it modifies itself \n\nWe've taken a look at LLVM bitcode and Python/Ruby/Java-esque bytecode as IR - and they share the same format of some kind of language that looks like instructions. Hotspot, Graal and V8 have an IR called \"Sea of Nodes\" (pioneered by Hotspot) which is essentially a lower level AST. One can imagine how Seas of Nodes are effective IR, as much of profiling work is based on a notion of a certain path not being taken often (or being traversed in a particular pattern). Note that these compiler ASTs are distinct from the parser AST.\nI'm usually all for \"try this at home!\" but getting graphs to browse is actually a bit difficult, albeit lots of fun and often very helpful for understanding compiler flows. I for one, cannot read all the graphs not only by limits of knowledge but by the computation power of my brain (which can be mediated with compiler options to get rid of behaviours I don't care about)\n\nFor V8, you'll need to build V8 and then use the D8 tool with the flag --print-ast. For Graal, --vm.Dgraal.Dump=Truffle:2. These give you text outputs (formatted such that you can get a graph out of them). I'm not sure how V8 developers generate visual graphs but Oracle provides \"Ideal Graph Visualizer\", which is used above. I did not have the energy to reinstall IGV so instead I have graphs from Chris Seaton generated with Seafoam which is not currently open sourced.\nAnyway, let us look at a JavaScript AST!\nfunction accumulate(n, a) {\n  var x = 0;\n  for (var i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {\n    x += a;\n  }\n  return x;\n}\n\naccumulate(1, 1)\n\nAbove is the code that I’ve run through d8 --print-ast test.js, though we only care about the function accumulate. You’ll notice that I only call it once, which means that I don’t have to wait for any compilation to occur in order to get an AST. \nBelow is the AST (with some non-essential lines removed) \nFUNC at 19\n.

The AST below was generated with Acorn.js\n\nA distinct difference is the variable declarations. In the parser-AST, no actual declaration is explicit for the parameters, and the declaration for the loop is tucked away under the ForStatement node. In the compiler-level AST, all declarations are grouped, along with addresses and metadata. \nThe compiler-level AST also uses this wacky VAR PROXY thing. The parser-level AST cannot actually identify which names correspond to which variables (by addresses) due to hoisting and eval and whatnot. So the compiler AST uses PROXY variables that are later connected to the actual variable. \n// This chunk is the declarations and the assignment of `x = 0` \n. DECLS\n. .

Red is control flow, blue is water data flow, and arrows are directions. Note that the fact that this graph appears simpler than the AST from V8, does not indicate that Graal has better simplified the program. Rather, this graph is generated from Java which is much less dynamic. The same Graal graph generated from Ruby would closer resemble that first photo of the graph. \nThe fun part about Graal graphs is that these ASTs will actually change depending on execution. This graph was generated by calling the function many times, with random parameters so that the function doesn’t get optimized away and with OSR and inlining disabled. The dump actually gives you a whole folder of graphs! Graal uses a self-specializing AST to optimize their programs (V8 will make similar optimizations, but not at the AST level). When you dump the Graal graphs you get well over a dozen graphs at different levels of optimization. In node rewriting, nodes replace themselves (specialize) with a different node. \nThe above graph is a great example of a specialization on a dynamically typed language (image from “One VM to Rule Them All”, 2013). The reason for this process to exist ties in closely with how partial evaluation works - it’s all about the specialization.\nYay, JIT compiled code! Let's compile it again! And again! \n\nI've been teasing \"Tiering\" since Part 1, so let's finally get a look into it! It is the simple concept that if we're not ready to create the most optimized code yet, but interpreting is still expensive, we can compile early once and then compile again when we're ready to generate more optimized code.\nHotspot is a tiering JIT, with two compilers; C1 and C2. The C1 compiler will kick in first and do a quick compile and run then run full profiling to get C2 compiled code. This can help clear up a lot of our concerns with warmup. Unoptimized compiled code is still faster than interpreting and aquiring that unoptimized compiled code is faster. Another fancy thing is that not all code will be compiled by C1 and C2. If a function is deemed trivial enough, it's very likely that optimized C2 output will not be helpful and no attempt will be made (and profiling time is saved!). If perhaps C1 is busy compiling, then the profiling can continue and skip C1 to be compiled by C2 directly.\n\nJavaScript Core tiers even harder! In fact, it has three JITs. JSC's interpreter also does light profiling, then moves onto the Baseline JIT, then to the DFG (Data Flow Graph) JIT, and finally to the FTL (Faster than Light) JIT. With these tiers, the meaning of deoptimization is no longer limited to a compiler-to-interpreter path, but deoptimization can happen from the DFG to the Baseline JIT (this doesn't seem to be the case for Hotspot C2-&gt;C1). These deoptimizations and passes into the next tier are done through on-stack-replacement.\nThe Baseline JIT kicks in by 100 executions and the DFG JIT kicks in at about 1000 executions (with exceptions) which means that the JIT gets compiled code much more quickly than say Pypy (which took about 3000 executions). The tiering strategy enables the JIT to try to match the amount of time spent executing the code with the amount of time spent optimizing the code. There are a whole bunch more handy tricks as to which kind of optimizations (inlining, type inferencing, etc) are done at which tier and why that's optimal!\nRelated Readings \n\nIn vague order of how they're related to the blog post.\n\n\nHow LuaJIT's Trace Compiler Works from Mike Pall\n\n\nImpact of Meta-tracing on VMs by Laurie Tratt\n\n\nPypy Escape Analysis\n\n\nWhy Users aren't More Happy with VMs by Laurie Tratt\n\n\nThings About JS Engines\n\nList of V8 Compiler Options\nJSCore Replacing their LLVM Backend for a \"Faster Than Light\" JIT\n\n\n\nThings about Deoptimizations\n\nDeoptimizing TruffleRuby Lazy Initialization by me\nDeoptimizing Ruby by Chris Seaton\nV8 Lazy Deopts\n\n\n\nThings About Graal\n\nOne VM to Rule Them All (a paper)\nHigh Performance C Extensions by Chris Seaton\nUnderstanding Graal Graphs by Chris Seaton\nTop 10 Things to do with GraalVM by Chris Seaton\n\n\n\nThings about Partial Evaluation\n\nPartial Evaluation vs Meta-tracing\nPaper that introduces partial evaluation for Graal\n\n\n\nMisc\n\nBenchmarking correctly is hard by Julia Evans\n\n\n\nUpcoming Blog Post: Allocation Optimizations for JITs \n\nWhen I started writing this post it wasn't for public consumption but to help me model my information.

This is actually fairly true, and it's fun to learn about compiler internals and often useful for programmers everywhere!\nThis blog post gives background on how programming languages are implemented and how JITs work. It'll introduce the implementation details of the Julia language, though it won't talk about specific implementation details or optimizations made by more traditional JITs. Check out How JIT Compilers are Implemented and Fast: Julia, Pypy, LuaJIT, Graal and More to read about how meta-tracing is implemented, how Graal supports C extensions, the relationship of JITs with LLVM and more!\nHow Programming Languages are Implemented \n\nWhen we run a program, it’s either interpreted or compiled in some way. The compiler/interpreter is sometimes referred to as the \"implementation\" of a language, and one language can have many implementations. You may have heard things like \"Python is interpreted\", but that really means the reference(standard/default) implementation of Python is an interpreter. Python is a language specification and CPython is the interpreter and implementation of Python. \nAn interpreter is a program that directly executes your code. Well-known interpreters are usually written in C. Ruby, Python and PHP are written in C. Below is a function that loosely models how an interpreter might work:\nfunc interpret(code string) {\n  if code == \"print('Hello, World!')\" {\n    print(\"Hello, World\");\n  } else if code == “x = 0; x += 4; print(x)” {\n    variable_x := 0 \n    variable_x += 4\n    print(x)\n  }\n}\n\nA compiler is a program that translates code from some language to another language, though it usually refers to a destination language that is a machine code. Examples of compiled languages are C, Go and Rust.\nfunc compile(code string) {\n  []byte compiled_code = get_machine_code(code);\n  write_to_executable(compiled_code);\n}\n\nThe difference between a compiled and interpreted language is actually much more nuanced. C, Go and Rust are clearly compiled, as they output a machine code file - which can be understood natively by the computer. The compile and run steps are fully distinct.\nHowever, compilers can translate to any target language (this is sometimes called transpiling). Java for example, has a two-step implementation. The first is compiling Java source to bytecode, which is an Intermediate Representation (IR). The bytecode is then JIT compiled - which involves interpretation.\nPython and Ruby also execute in two steps. Despite being known as interpreted languages, their reference implementations actually compile the source down to a bytecode. You may have seen .pyc files (not anymore in Python3) which contain Python bytecode! The bytecode is then interpreted by a virtual machine. These interpreters use bytecode because programmers tend to care less about compile time, and creating a bytecode language allows the engineers to specify a bytecode that is as efficient to interpret as possible. \nHaving bytecode is how languages check syntax before execution (though they could technically just do a pass before starting the interpreter). An example below shows why you would want to check syntax before runtime.\nsleep(1000)\nbad syntax beep boop beep boop\n\nAnother important note is that interpreted languages are typically slower for various reasons, the most obvious being that they're executed in a higher level language that has overhead execution time. The main reason is that the dynamic-ness of the languages they tend to implement means that they need many extra instructions to decide what to do next and how to route data. People still choose to build interpreters over compilers because they're easier to build and are more suited to handle things like dynamic typing, scopes etc (though you could build a compiler that has the same features). \nSo What is a JIT? \n\nA JIT compiler doesn't compile code Ahead-Of-Time (AOT), but still compiles source code to machine code and therefore is not an interpreter. JITs compile code at runtime, while your program is executing. This gives the JITs flexibility for dynamic language features, while maintaining speed from optimized machine code output. JIT-compiling C would make it slower as we'd just be adding the compilation time to the execution time. JIT-compiling Python would be fast, as compilation + executing machine code can often be faster than interpreting, especially since the JIT has no need to write to a file (disk writing is expensive, memory/RAM/register writing is fast). JITs also improve in speed by being able to optimize on information that is only available at runtime.\nJulia: a JIT Compiler that's Just-in-time \n\nA common theme between compiled languages is that they're statically typed. That means when the programmer creates or uses a value, they’re telling the computer what type it is and that information is guaranteed at compile time.\nJulia is dynamically typed, but internally Julia is much closer to being statically typed.\nfunction multiply(x, y)\n  x * y\nend\n\nHere is an example of a Julia function, which could be used to multiply integers, floats, vectors, strings etc (Julia allows operator overloading). Compiling out the machine code for all these cases is not very productive for a variety of reasons, which is what we'd have to do if we wanted Julia to be a compiled language. Idiomatic programming means that the function will probably only be used by a few combinations of types and we don't want to compile something that we don't use yet since that's not very jitty (this is not a real term).\nIf I were to code multiply(1, 2), then Julia will compile a function that multiplies integers. If I then wrote multiply(2, 3), then the already-compiled code will be used. If I then added multiply(1.4, 4), another version of the function will be compiled. We can observe what the compilation does with @code_llvm multiply(1, 1), which generates LLVM Bitcode (not quite machine code, but a lower-level Intermediate Representation).\ndefine i64 @julia_multiply_17232(i64, i64) {\ntop:\n; ┌ @ int.jl:54 within `*'\n   %2 = mul i64 %1, %0\n; └\n  ret i64 %2\n}\n\nAnd with multiply(1.4, 4), you can see how complicated it can get to compile even one more function. In AOT compiled Julia, all (some optimizations can be made to reduce) of these combinations would have to live in the compiled code even if only one was used, along with the control flow to delegate. \ndefine double @julia_multiply_17042(double, i64) {\ntop:\n; ┌ @ promotion.jl:312 within `*'\n; │┌ @ promotion.jl:282 within `promote'\n; ││┌ @ promotion.jl:259 within `_promote'\n; │││┌ @ number.jl:7 within `convert'\n; ││││┌ @ float.jl:60 within `Float64'\n       %2 = sitofp i64 %1 to double\n; │└└└└\n; │ @ promotion.jl:312 within `*' @ float.jl:405\n   %3 = fmul double %2, %0\n; └\n  ret double %3\n}\n\nThe general strategy of “assume a type and compile/behave based on that” is called type inferencing, which Julia mildly uses in the examples above. There are a lot of other compiler optimizations that are made, though none of them are very specific to JITs as Julia may be better described as a lazy AOT compiler.\nThe simplicity of this kind of jitting makes it easy for Julia to also supply AOT compilation. It also helps Julia to benchmark very well, definitely a tier above languages like Python and comparable to C (I'd cite numbers, but those are always nuanced and I don't want to get into that).\nSo What is a JIT? Take Two. \n\nJulia is actually the jittiest JIT I'll discuss, but not the most interesting as a \"JIT\". It actually compiles code right before the code needs to be used -- just in time. Most JITs however (Pypy, Java, JS Engines), are not actually about compiling code just-in-time, but compiling optimal code at an optimal time. In some cases that time is actually never. In other cases, compilation occurs more than once. In a vast majority of the cases compilation doesn't occur until after the source code has been executed numerous times, and the JIT will stay in an interpreter as the overhead to compilation is too high to be valuable.\n\nThe other aspect at play is generating optimal code. Assembly instructions are not created equal, and compilers will put a lot of effort into generating well-optimized machine code. Usually, it is possible for a human to write better assembly than a compiler (though it would take a fairly smart and knowledgeable human), because the compiler cannot dynamically analyze your code. By that, I mean things like knowing the possible range of your integers or what keys are in your map, as these are things that a computer could only know after (partially) executing your program. A JIT compiler can actually do those things because it interprets your code first and gathers data from the execution. Thus, JITs are expensive in that they interpret, and add compilation time to execution time, but they make it up in highly optimised compiled code. With that, the timing of compilation is also dependent on whether the JIT has gathered enough valuable information.\nThe cool part about JITs is that I was sort of lying when I said a JIT implementation of C could not be faster than existing compiled implementations. It would not be feasible to try, but jit-compiling C in the way I just described is not a strict superset of compiling a language and thus it is not logically impossible to compile code fast enough to make up for the compile+profile+interpreting time. If I \"JIT compiled\" C similarly to how Julia does it (statically compile each function as it's called), it would be impossible to make it faster than compiled-C as the compile-time is non-negative and the generated machine code is essentially the same.\n\nPogo \n\nThough jitting C is not feasible, one can find a middle ground through Profile Guided Optimization (PGO, cutely [and uncommonly] pronounced “pogo”). Instead of profiling while executing, you compile a program with PGO profiling, run that program and then recompile the original program with profiled data passed in. This is effective at reducing compiled-code size and improving branch prediction. \n\nWarm it up \n\nJITs have a concept of warming up. Because intepretation and profiling time is expensive, JITs will start by executing a program slowly and then work towards \"peak performance\". For JITs with interpreted counterparts like Pypy, the JIT without warmup performs much worse at the beginning of execution due to the overhead of profiling. It's also the reason that JITs will consume signifcantly more memory. \n\nWarmup adds complexity to measuring efficiency of a JIT! It's fine if you're measuring the performance of generating the mandelbrot set, but becomes painful if you're serving a web application and the first N requests are painfully slow. It’s complicated by the fact that the performance doesn’t strictly increase. If Pypy decides it needs to compile many things all at once after JITs compiling some functions, then you might have a slow-down in the middle. It also makes benchmark results more ambiguous, as you have to check if the jitted languages were given time to warmup, but you’d also want to know if it took an unseemly amount of time to warmup. Optimizing your compiled code and warmup speed is unfortunately zero-sum(or at least small-sum) by nature. If you try to get your code to compile sooner, less data will be available, the compiled code will not be as efficient and peak performance will be lower. Aiming for higher peak performance of course, often means higher profiling costs.\nJava and Javascript engines are examples of JITs that have put really good care into warmup time, but you may find that languages built for academic uses have monstrous warmup times in favour of snazzy peak performances.\n&gt; Next Post in Series: How JIT Compilers are Implemented and Fast: Julia, Pypy, LuaJIT, Graal and More \n\n\nTalks about implementation of tracing JITs and meta-tracing JITs, specifically LuaJIT and Pypy\nIntroduces GraalVM, Hotspot and goes deeper into Javascript Engines.

These are not the most fun things as I tried to avoid writing about things that were already nicely summarized, but they will at least be tastefully boring!\nInspiration \n\nIn the mid 1980s, Guido van Rossum was working on ABC, a generally unpopular high-level language intended for teaching and prototyping. Based on his frustrations with ABC, Guido wanted Python to have a large and powerful standard library. Python (first released in 1991) would soon be joined by Java (released in 1995) in having such a standard library.\nContrary to C, Lisp (and lisp dialects) and Ruby, Python does not allow statements inside an expression. For example, if (x = y) (or more practically, if (line = readline(file))) could be used in C though Python does not allow them. The goal here was probably to make Python easy to use and to protect its users from common errors such as accidentally typing x = y instead of x == y. But also uhh... there's a walrus operator (:=) for assignment expressions in Python 3.8 so maybe I just lied. \nFrom Haskell and Lisp, Python inherited support for functional programming, with filter, map and reduce. Python documentation lists the itertools module under Functional Programiming Modules and credits Standard ML, APL and Haskell for its constructs.\nSyntactically, Python was unique in not taking on many braces or brackets as C, Lisp and Java would. It introduced keywords such as and and or rather than &amp;&amp; and ||. This is inline with Python's philosophy, which we'll dive into later.\nPython is fairly different from many of its predecessors, though the language Guido wanted to be most different from is Perl. TMTOWTDI (pronounced \"Tim Toady\") is a Perl motto which stands for \"There's more than one way to do it\". One of Python's design principles, published in the \"Zen of Python\" in 1999 is \"There should be one — and preferably only one — obvious way to do it\", directly conflicting with Perl.\nAlso, it was influenced by some actual art. Specifically, Python was named after Monty Python.\nOh yeah there are some people you should know \n\n\nGuido van Rossum. Benevolent Dictator for Life, until of course he stepped down on 12 July 2018 and now sits on a steering council of five.\nTim Peters. Made Timsort (what Python and V8 uses). Wrote the Zen of Python, was on Python's board of directors from 2001-2014 and got involved in the early 1990s.\nBarry Warsaw. Core Python developer since mid 90's. Used to be the lead maintainer of Jython, a Java implementation of Python. Currently employed by LinkedIn to work on Python.\n\nCase Study: The Increment/Decrement Operators \n\nMany question why in Python one cannot do x++ or x-- especially since it's a common thing for people to know, is less characters than x += 1, etc etc. Its existence not hugely relevant to Python programmers, but the reasons why it doesn't exist reveals a lot about Python. \n\nZen of Python \"There should be one — and preferably only one — obvious way to do it\". \nABC never had that operator, so it may have been a fairly intuitive decision. \nIt might've been implemented by C just for an optimization as the instructions for x++ could be more easily optimized (source).\nPython is serious about keeping its LL parser, which would make ++a bit a pain to differentiate from + +. (--3will evaluate to 3 in Python)\n\nThe most obvious reason of course, is that Guido didn't want anyone making Python++.\nSome Weird Shit: For...Else \n\nfor i in range(42):\n    if i == -1:\n        print(\"This will not happen\")\n        break\nelse:\n    print(\"Will this?\")\n\nThe answer is yes, yes it does happen!\nIf a loop does not break, Python will try to go to an else block.\nIs this a stupid feature? Probably. There seems to be just... a bunch of better and more readable ways to do this. I'm not even going to give an example since there are so many reasons why you might want this kind of logic flow. \nLet's not forget that brilliant Zen of Python line. \"There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.\" Not only are there many ways to do this, a for...else statement is certainly the least obvious way.\nThe Zen of Python has many thoughts. The follow up to that line is \"Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.\" The Dutch is referring to none other than Guido himself. So yeah, maybe this is just a mistake that Python made and can never walk back from, since there are definitely people out there using this thing. You can read the mailing list issue about it here (https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-ideas/2009-October/006155.html)\nBut how did it end up here in the first place you ask?\nBasically this kind of thing became a feature because Donald Knuth used it, and everyone knew about what Donald Knuth does so it made sense. It also made more sense when people used gotos to model their logic flow more frequently as all the loops had a if statement and goto. \nThe entire for...else block can logically be thought of one piece of code, and the break just jumps to the end and ignores the else. If it doesn't break, then it continues to the else block. You can also try...else! \nThe Zen of Python \n\nNow that we've talked about two points of the text, let's look at the whole thing.\nBeautiful is better than ugly.\nExplicit is better than implicit.\nSimple is better than complex.\nComplex is better than complicated.\nFlat is better than nested.\nSparse is better than dense.\nReadability counts.\nSpecial cases aren't special enough to break the rules.\nAlthough practicality beats purity.\nErrors should never pass silently.\nUnless explicitly silenced.\nIn the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.\nThere should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.\nAlthough that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.\nNow is better than never.\nAlthough never is often better than *right* now.\nIf the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.\nIf the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.\nNamespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!\n\nYou can get the Zen of Python in a handy Easter Egg, by writing import this.

What's that, it's False? \n\nFrom the Python 3.5 changelog;\n\nBefore Python 3.5, a datetime.time object was considered to be false if it represented midnight in UTC. This behavior was considered obscure and error-prone and has been removed in Python 3.5.\n\nUmm, ok I guess. This wasn't really a mistake, this behaviour was correctly documented. And, it's consistent behaviour ish. 0 in general is a falsy thing. 0, [], etc etc.\nIt was actually raised as an issue in 2012, by someone who thought it was a bug. It was passed on because of the reasons stated above, but people came back about this in 2014! Particularly, this weird behaviour made doing if timeobj (where timeobj might be set to some falsy value) useless. Someone made a good argument that this type of 0 shouldn't count the way that others do, as time cannot really be multiplied and such and thus doesn't really represent a numeric value in the traditional sense. It wasn't fixed (released) until September 2015!\nSome Actual History: 2000 to 2010 \n\n\nJanuary 17, 2001: Jython was created\n2003: BOOLEANS CAME TO PYTHON!

New decade, new Python. \n\nThis Used to be Silly Episode 2: the GIL \n\nThe GIL is silly! Well, no not really it's pretty important and hard to remove. The Global Interpreter Lock makes it so that Python code cannot actually be executed in parallel, so threads are executed concurrently in a way where they're \"running at the same time\", but never both running at a given time. \nIt's not just a \"Python was implemented this way so we're stuck with it\" thing going on here. Pypy came along and it kept the GIL. Ruby has a GIL. OCaml has a GIL. JS just...doesn't have threads. Yeah yeah, IronPython and Jython got rid of the GIL, but I'd like to hammer it in that there is a great argument for the GIL to be great. \nSo the silly part is what it was like before Python 3.2. \nIf you were to divide work between two threads, you'd imagine that it would be slightly slower than having one thread run it, since the time it takes for the GIL to be passed around cannot be &lt;= 0. The keyword there is slightly. What you'd get before Python 3.2 is that it could be twice as slow. Oh no. \nA quick description of the problem lies in how the GIL was implemented. The logic for it resulted in a system, where every so often (very often), a thread that might be waiting for the GIL will jump up and scream for the GIL, another thread will probably say \"no you can't have it, that's mine\" and the other thread will just keep jumping up and down and wasting time. The new implementation used an approach that was a bit more \"Ok I'm done with the GIL now, who wants it?\". \nThis is a very high level abstraction and somewhat misleading. But tl;dr the GIL was being silly for a long time and no one fixed it. You can watch Dave Beazely's talk on it. \nHall of Fame of things that were broken for a long time and no one noticed non-Python related \n\n\nTim Peters is brilliant not only for Python but also for Timsort! It's used by Python, JS and the millions of Java things. That algorithm was designed in 2002. In 2015, some guys tried to formally verify it, and found it was broken!    Link to paper\nThe left-pad shenanigans. Basically, npm didn't have any fallback or handling if the dependency of a dependency of a... got removed. So when the tiniest package left npm, everything exploded! Most apps just stopped running. Rust with their package manager cargo just didn't let people remove packages (not in a breaking way at least), somehow npm missed that.\nKnight Capital had a bug that disrupted the NYSE and also lost them $460 million! This isn't the strict definition of broken, but there was so much broken in their systems that I have 0 surprise this happened. They received 97 emails about an incorrect configuration after a deploy at 8AM, an hour before trading opened which should've been good warning to rollback, delay or at least throttle. By 10AM, the 460 million was lost. They let that shit run for 45 minutes! The error occurred because devops team failed to update one of the 8 servers. The old code that caused the failure had been obsolete for 9 years. Dead code should be considered a bug, thank you. \n\nLegacy \n\nJulia \n\nJulia quotes \"We want something as usable for general programming as Python\" on their Why We Created Julia post. Though Julia is fundamentally different by being JITed-ish and more static, their common use in data science showcases some fundamental similarities.\nRuby \n\nThe creator of Ruby, Matz said \"I wanted a scripting language that was more powerful than Perl, and more object-oriented than Python\". It took on a similar engineering path by having a VM (YARV) and creating bytecode for it! Ruby also has a lot of similar syntax such as not having brackets and built itself a very large standard library. A huge difference however, is that Ruby has a lot more complicated grammer (probably inherited through Perl, along with some other crap) through the use of an LALR parser instead of Python's home-grown LL parser. \nGo \n\nSeveral companies have actually migrated from Python to Go, a symbol of success for Go. On their FAQ they list a few reasons as to how Python affected them. The big thing was that go wanted static typing, while keeping a \"fluid\" language the way Python does. This is a huge win for Go, as I feel a large part of their goal is to encourage good code (and there's a general consensus that typing is good for that). Unlike many other languages that are more recently made, Go keeps the braces. Go basically ran away from all the fluidity that Python, Ruby and Julia have. \nDropbox has migrated some important components to Go, along with maintaining Go packages. Twitch rewrote their IRC chat system in Go. Uber rewrote some vital datastores workers in Go. \nEnd of Post Ramble \n\nIn general, syntax is a big one for Python's influence, with CoffeeScript and Swift joining the list. \nPython's usage in machine learning is the one thing that will keep Python in the history books. When the future aliens or whatnot study the development of AI, they'll remember the language that footed it. \nPython has also footed pieces of internet history, including Wikipedia, Facebook, Amazon and Google. Though it may not be in the history books, Doki Doki Literature Club is a popular video game built in Python and maybe it'll be games like that to make a retro comeback the same way we have emulators for old consoles today! \nI tried to come up with a tl;dr to this post, but I don't really have one. I started writing with the intention of showing people how important Python will be to history, but I got carried away with random Python stuffs in my head but I guess that's fine. \nI cited sources / provided additional content where I deemed it would be helpful (ie hard to find with a quick Google). If anyone has questions about anything, please email me at hello@carolchen.me since I did quite a bit of research on everything I wrote here. \n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/technical/python-history-since-the-fifteenth-century/","title":"Python History Since the Fifteenth Century"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/technical/tf-go/":{"body":"\nAll code examples can be found in this repo.
