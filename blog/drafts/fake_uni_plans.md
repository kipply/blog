# my fake university plans

Long story short, I never started university, I probably never will. Last time I considered going to school it was for Waterloo, and I was thinking so hard about it that I made this! All the courses I'd want to take at Waterloo (adhering to graduation requirements and whatnot).

I'm mostly writing about CS career plans, so I'm going to ignore the Japanese and other parts of my fake university plans like going to parties and staying up till 3AM talking to your roommates about nothing. Anyway here's the list again, now with courses I'd want to take today, circled!

Five circles seems pretty manageable! I devised a master plan to get the education I wanted out of university into my life. Here is a list of topics I hope to cover, why I want to and how I'll do it. Given my track record for planning, I'll never get around to it all but yep

## Compilers

I like compilers! I probably want to be employed working on them again, they're helpful to know about when working with lower level software, and are the cutest pieces of software. I did work on a Graal language before and I'm [familiar with JITs](https://carolchen.me/blog/jits-impls/) and interpreters, but I want to work on register alloc, write garbage collectors, work on code gen etc. 

I would like to work on that in a university course, here are things I think I would want: 

- Project focused (write a compiler)
- Lectures unrelated to project (branch prediction? random llvm tidbits and features?)
- Please do not make me write a parser from scratch

## Concurrency

Concurrency I've mostly covered over the years building systems or working with compilers, so I'm not particularly interested in a course. From what people tell me the typically 3rd or 2nd year course is difficult (concurrency problems and strategies get logically complicated) but aren't good at talking about concurrency in regards to UNIX, operating systems, networking, etc. I'd still elect to take this course should I have gone to school. 

## Networking

Networking seems potentially interesting, as a course seems to have the same status as concurrency -- good course, might not cover everything I'd be interested in. If were in university, I'd definitely elect to take it. Things that I'd be interested in are; 

- TCP|UDP architecture
- Multicast
- Internet Protocol Versions
- Building a VPN

Most networking courses have things I'd want to learn, I hope to find a few videos that cover some things and structured labs so that I have motivation to build+test.  

## Machine Learning

I work at an AI company, so I kind of just pick this one up? There's so much more lore on how to become an MLE or Researcher than any of these other subjects so I won't say much. 

The sparkly thing about ML is that you can become an excellent ML Programmer (especially excellent in terms of career) while being extremely specialized. Really 

I dislike being specialized, I'd like to work on scaling model APIs and GPU programming 

## Databases



## Math



## Graphics

## Operating Systems

## Combinatorics and Probability

## Distributed Systems
