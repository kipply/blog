# i have university at home.

Long story short, I never started university, I never will! Last time I considered going to school it was for Waterloo CS, and I was thinking so hard about it that I picked all my courses for all four years. Having not gone to college, it's hard to establish my authority as someone who knows the nature of specific college courses though I believe to know them reasonably well through talking to a lot of different people (basically entirely Waterloo, UofToronto and elite US schools in that order).

Here is a list of topics I hope to cover, why I want to and how I'll do it. Or at least, all the CS related ones.

## Compilers

I like compilers! I probably want to be employed working on them again, they're helpful to know about when working with lower level software, and are the most elegant pieces of software. I did work on a Graal language before and I'm [familiar with JITs](https://kipp.ly/blog/jits-impls/) and interpreters, but I'd like to do the rest of the things.

I would like to work on that in a university course, here are things I think I would want:

- Project focused (write a compiler)
- Lectures unrelated to project (branch prediction? random llvm tidbits and features?)
- Please do not make me write a parser from scratch

## Networking

Networking seems potentially interesting, as a course seems to have the same status as concurrency -- good course, might not cover everything I'd be interested in. If were in university, I'd definitely elect to take it since I still know close to nothing and it got in the way of me scaling infrastructure at the startup I work at. Things that I'd be interested in are;

- TCP|UDP architecture
- Multicast
- Internet Protocol Versions
- Building a VPN

Most networking courses have things I'd want to learn, I hope to find a few videos that cover some things and structured labs so that I have motivation to build+test.

## Machine Learning

I'm actually coming here explicitly to say I would never take a machine learning course! Never!!!!

## Maths

## Graphics

## Operating Systems

## Distributed Systems

## Things I Don't Want To Do

Some courses are sort of useful, but I probably never actually want to do them and the reasons why are supposedly informative.

_Concurrency_
Though concurrency courses seem much harder than the amount of concurrency the average programmer practices in a year which makes it maybe fun but I think it's something better learned on the job as it's a problem solving skill that is best developed through doing exercises. I think maybe there's a good concurrency course (or just a set of exercises) that teaches it in contexts of operating systems, networking or distributed systems.

_Databases_
Similar vein to concurrency regarding better learned on the job, with an addition that databases are thoroughly uninteresting to many and the ways in which they are interesting are very specific to certain technologies which makes it hard to create resources for. It's also hard to work on those interesting aspects unless you work at a company large enough for those things to arise.
