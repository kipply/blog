Some of the worst bikeshedding is seen in "is it in a framework or library?". That definition is about who's in charge of the flow, whether you choose when and how you call the software. This is a useful distinction, but I have a different (better) framing. It leads to nothing useful, but I like having a model to think about what my software is doing for me. 

Frameworks are about structuring the way you think -- a framework of thinking. People talk a lot about a framework for thinking. It's not about more knowledge, it extends past using tools and its also not strictly about doing things faster. A lot of software exists not primarily to do things for you, but to give you a way of organizing your thoughts in a way that is more intuitive and efficient. It closes the gap between how you to think about the software in your mind and what code needs to be written to bring it to life. 

With this, software like React is a framework. It primarily exists to help you organize your thoughts. Though React is higher level than vanilla javascript, you could (try to) close that gap without being as invasive as React was with completing changing the way you think about the code. JQuery is obviously not a framework, it's there to do things for you and help you write less code. The way I structure vanilla javascript and vanilla javascript + JQuery would be exactly the same. 

With this, Rails is still a framework, but possibly less so than React is. It becomes more of a framework when more features are used. It also means that Rails is significantly more of a framework than say, Express.js is. 

In the wavy zone, tensorflow might be a framework even though it is very explicitly used as a library.
