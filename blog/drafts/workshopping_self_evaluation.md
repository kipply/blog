there was a significant period in my life where i had a value misalignment, in a way where i took a look at it and thought "Oh I Do Not Like My Preferences Here". i had ended up in a place where i valued underevaluating myself more than an accurate evaluation. it was a little due to social pressure and because i thought (and continue to believe) that humility and not-taking-myself-seriously are traits i want in myself.

for a while it wasn't obvious i was doing this, i had all the reason to believe it was. it took a while and one day i realised that social pressure to undervalue myself, which motivated me to reason myself into undervaluation. it's a little tricky, since it was only slightly surface social pressure but mostly how much i value humility for the sake of other people. my initial reaction to why this is bad wos epistemics, which was wholly sufficient to power the distaste. i like being correct, it's aesthetic to be accurate. though, one can probably come up with better reasons as to why accurate self-evaluation is superior to alternatives.

<!-- Claim: If you have values such that you think overvaluation or undervaluation is superior to accurate self-evaluation, then you should want to change your values.

Self-evaluation aids in forming much better goals and actions to take to get to those goals. Accuracy here can better identify problem points, how much help you need and more precisely evaluate how much improvement you want. It also helps identify when there are swings in confidence and insecurity, as ok as they are. These swings happen whether or not one's self-evaluation is particularly accurate, but the same skills that lead to accurate self-evaluation lead to being good at identifying these swings.

I've heard some pretty good cases that overvaluation is good because confidence feels good and that undervaluation is good because it's motivating. These are rather nuanced, but I haven't met anyone who properly feels this way. Though harder for particular people in certain situtaions, it's entirely possible to decouple emotions of confidence and determination from their self-evaluations. People have a surprising amount of range when  -->
