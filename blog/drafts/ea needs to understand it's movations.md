I think something that is overlooked is that it is extremely hard to find reasons to be a good person -- no matter your definition of good. The overlooking is partially due to it being a weird meta question to think about. It's also due to biases about "good people don't have to try hard to be good" which I'd like to dispel immediately, both as a utility monster and as an emotional introspective person who finds the notion upsetting.

Perhaps, the reason it's so hard to be good, is that there aren't many good reasons to. There are hardly even reasons to want to be good -- and the distinction between wanting to be good and being good is already quite fuzzy.

### Religion
Religion is the age-old reason to be good, and in many ways the best. At least for Christianity, I would bet on most moral frameworks rating the average Christian as a better person than an atheist.

How it does this is that it sets some clear goals for individuals and for the state of the world, as well as providing ample infrastructure for one to get there. You want to practice being a good person to the best of your ability (which is nice, because it must be possible) and spread the word to the best of your ability. There is money
