I recently had the incredible privilege and experience of interviewing at five places that all would've been great options for just about anyone in my position. Even more than the details of interview processes, the ins and outs of considerations, emotional whims and impactful conversations are rarely documented. I write this as love letters to these companies and to eternalise this experience for myself, complete with dramatic Bad Apple lyrics.

### Blue Rose Research

Comparing the efficacy of two good deeds is often executed poorly, and is always deeply uncomfortable. I had the difficult experience of comparing working on getting Democrats elected and working on AI Alignment. I never really reached a conclusion, but at least for me the positive impact I could make in either endeavour was a close call. Blue Rose is a group that "helps campaigns make higher quality strategic decisions by democratizing access to accurate measurement" and talking to them made that feel like a drastic understatement. I'm quite confident that working at Blue Rose is a great way to make a positive impact and that they have a really stellar engineering team.

My relationship with Blue Rose started in the summer of 2021 when I tagged along to the party of some supposedly well known person (and [head data scientist](https://twitter.com/davidshor) at Blue Rose), found myself chatting with some Blue Rose people and left deciding that they were extremely smart, dedicated (they could all be making oodles more money elsewhere) and it was a shame they were not on my radar before. I'm genuinely not inspired often, but the combination of dedication and whatever the opposite of learned helplessness is that they demonstrated did that for me.

They also had one of the better interview questions I had come across, where the format was being given a small project written with various bugs / code quality flaws and being asked to investigate and fix various parts of it -- this was pretty neat!

It's surely not uncommon for people to consider jobs based on morality, but this was at least my first time thinking about it. What was difficult for me is that what I cared about most was not the same as what I emotionally respond to. Building impactful products is a thrill! Doing AI research doesn't have the same kick. Politics certainly has that kick. I believe in doing what I think is most important, which pointed to staying in AI work but it was hard for me to tell if that was really the case or if I was just picking money and status.

I'm still a little bothered in this decision, but the least I can do is suggest you to [apply](https://boards.greenhouse.io/blueroseresearch) and do what I couldn't.

### OpenAI

I nearly did not apply to OpenAI out of loyalty to Cohere. As a direct competitor this seemed like a significant betrayal, not just to the team I'd leave behind but also to myself. OpenAI did a lot for me in terms of getting me to stop mulling over "why am I leaving" and translating that into a much more productive "what am I looking for?". Some of it was just the situation (they were one of the earlier interviews) but it was also the talking to the people there. The part that activated this switch was that they really assumed that I wanted something fresh and challenging which is also a good sign of their energy!

In my intro call with Rob (recruiter) he asked what I want to work on and I half-jokingly said "haha not sure, wanna help me figure it out?" and Rob proceeded to help by finding fitting roles I would've failed to myself and talking me through a lot of decisioning. My interviews included talking with Jerry Tworek, whose team I was angling to join, and Jerry performed best in my manager screening criteria of "would I be comfortable crying in front of them" (I had other criteria too, btw). OpenAI came off as a place with an intense nerdiness about shipping things (nerdiness oft detracts from shipping things because technically-interesting will veer away from productive and vice versa) which I particularly liked and think is quite rare.

I think Rob (and probably other OAI recruiters) are possibly just magnitudes better than others I've seen in terms of being able to understand all the context, people's values and have productive conversations with them. It's hard to describe how good (both enjoyable and effective) the recruiting was here without going through all the details, but it was

It turned out that OpenAI was not the best fit for what I was looking for, which feels a bit misrepresentative to say because it was also a pretty good fit. Iâ€™m generally grateful for the process. I think it's good evidence that interviewing with companies you don't end up working at can be productive for one's job search.

### Adept AI

It's a little obscene how much I came to love [this company](https://www.adept.ai/), quite tangibly the recruiting equivalent of limerence.

What made it magical was that when I had just taken a call to get to know them in January my takeaway was something like "very competent team, but nothing to show for it yet and lacking direction" and seeing where they ended up just months later caused a surprising amount of adrenaline rush for something I had nothing to do with. The most compelling part about Adept to me was that early-stage startup adrenaline, having an intense and unique direction and emotionally registering to me as a chance to be a part of something like Cohere again.

The team communicated their culture exceptionally, it was really a show don't sell situation. I somewhat hesitantly asked if they'd be interested in interviewing in person and was thrilled when they said yes (I'm a big remote work hater) and walked into the office to be greeted by three beautiful dogs all excited to love me! I had lunch at their office before the four hours of interviewing and the team (incl. dogs) did a great job of having relaxed vibe-y time with me. In between interviews I rested on a couch, surrounded by dogs and ate some mango. I petted a dog during an interview too! The culture shone through in that this was the only set of interviews where I felt perfectly safe butting heads with the leadership. It was evidence of good communication norms, culture etc. but also way more respect for me than I expected.

Adept is going to be in my mind a lot partially because it was a really close call. Maybe if OpenAI hadn't shifted my mindset from thinking about what I wanted about Cohere to be different to thinking about what I want from scratch Adept would've been exactly what I wanted. Maybe a little less EA influence in my life, maybe if they had set up their home base in New York City. Maybe if I were more ambitious or adventurous.

I got them these stickers (they were almost called Persimmon AI Labs) and showed up at the office to gift it to them as a surprise but ended up chickening out and dropped them off in the lobby. I'm still not quite sure what I was worried about, I'm not a particularly nervous person. Probably some combination of social awkwardness, possible regret, and just high stress of interacting with situations related to life decisions. Oh well!

This is a place for my feelings, but I also happen to have thought and investigated pretty hard about whether they will be very successful + a great place to work, and the answer is approximately yes. You should [apply](https://jobs.lever.co/adeptailabs), I'll be jealous if you go.

### Jane Street

I was unconfident if I wanted to stay in ML. It was for bad reasons, like I thought maybe I wasn't good enough at machine learning (or rather that what I was doing wasn't machine learning at all as I do entirely engineering) or that the stakes in ML were too high for me to handle. I was confident these were bad feelings, and they weren't prominent but I still felt the need to explore them. When I applied, a part of me really wanted to go, not just for the leaving-ML reasons but also because I love Jane Street.

I'm _very_ picky about where I'm willing to work, in that I refuse to work anywhere that I'm not very familiar with. I've partied with the Blue Rose people, the OAI team I angled for had a friend I'd known for over half a decade and I had gotten to know the Adept team (and grilled their past coworkers). There are also other standards like having fun problems and good people which of course Jane Street meets.

My history with Jane Street started when I was in high school and a little stranded in Waterloo because of a snow storm. A then-former Jane Street intern now-fulltimer fed me, called my mom and made sure I made it home. Several of my friends from high school and previous internships went on to work at Jane Street, including a few of my former partners and best friends. It sounds a little bit capitalist dystopia, but my many years of having many friends at there and living in the unmistakable and beloved Jane Street culture resulted in me forming a very sentimental relationship with this proprietary trading firm.

Jane Street represented moving back to New York City to me. I moved to San Francisco in January with my former partner because he was leaving Jane Street for Anthropic, and I still probably prefer NYC for a lot of things. It made this job feel like going home, back to the old and evolving habits, hobbies, friends and culture I had brought to NYC with me from Toronto. I had only been in NYC for half a year! I was barely getting started with my life there. This is a jpg of me visiting the office for the first time in 2018, which was also the first time I visited and fell in love with NYC.

![](../img/janestreet.jpg)

The two things I'd really like to communicate is 1. that the culture is wonderful. People really enjoy working there, it's not a big scary evil bank that's going to drain your soul and hours while providing no fun (I think they have an immense amount of fun!). Secondly, they had hands-down _the best_ technical interviews.

They were better than I thought possible and impressively staffed at two people per interview. I went through five fantastic interview problems, not algorithmic or LeetCode like in nature and very representative of possible work people might do. They opened room for collaboration, and tested skills of problem solving, thinking about edge cases and implementation. I believe most "interview with real-world problems" questions don't do the full cognitive testing I would want in a process but Jane Street really nailed it.

> For reference, my team at Cohere did a debugging interview + implementation heavy (not algorithmic) interview + system design interview which covers skill testing well. It works well for Cohere because we need the sys design as we filter for experience at interview-time a bit more than Jane Street does.

I'm a little sad I didn't finally get my chance to learn functional programming. Uh, sometime after the AGI I guess.

> there'd be no more going back

### Cohere

_There's a funky thing that happens here where this section is the only one where I will say anything particularly negative which might result in inaccurately negative takeaways regarding my feelings on Cohere_

Even with offers from companies I'd rather work at, there was a long period of time where I was more sad to leave Cohere than I was excited to go elsewhere. I started at Cohere in May 2020, it was my first full-time job, I had gone in full-steam ahead as this was my redemption from the startup I had founded and abandoned the previous winter. I remember thinking really hard about whether I should stay at Shopify but at this point I don't really remember how I ended up at Cohere. I didn't really know the team well and I certainly didn't know the industry (see: me in 2020 googling "Geoffrey Hinton") but thank goodness I ended up there.

Cohere was a lot of great and important things for me! My first time in startup culture, probably the best manager I've ever had, the first time I really needed good management, my first experience managing and where I finally learned what a neural network was. Describing it seems a little silly, because it was good and special for all the same reasons other people find working at early stage startups good and special. It was thrilling, things moved quickly, I became very close with my co:lleagues, everything was exciting and my world was melting into this company.

Have to say, one of the funnest parts of Cohere was the success. How we grew from a scrappy team having meetings on the floor about product ideas that were in hindsight, wildly stupid to this large well resourced operation feels unreal. There were ups and downs and deep moments of doubts and attentively following our competitors wondering if we would ever be good enough, and all of that felt good.

Startups should be about [Type 0 fun](https://www.rei.com/blog/climb/fun-scale): fun in anticipation. Startups should be the most fun when you're anticipating and waiting and working for it to become successful, not as a triumphant success you look back on in satisfaction. For this, Cohere was an immense amount of fun, but it is also over for me.

Some number of years ago I thought about why I thought running a startup was a bad idea in many cases. A key point I missed in startups' favor is that authority goes a really long way when it comes to people who are primarily motivated by manifesting vision -- which is what startup founders should be doing. Outside of Cohere, I was never a vision manifester and in thinking of my future, it's also not what I'm currentyl out to do. Cohere made me a localised vision manifester, probably because I had so much room to decide what to do in the pre-product days and I had my hands in so many quickly changing things.

The first time I realised I might not be a successful vision manifester was when we came out of stealth in May 2021 and I believed (and still believe) that some of the marketing content we were planning to put out was dishonest but could not get it stricken before release. It was eventually removed for being so, which was a really strong "ah shit I can't do things here" moment. As an intern at Shopify I _definitely_ couldn't do things, but apparently I cared about Shopify a lot less than Cohere!

At some point I burnt out and stopped being a vision manifester, mostly because my standards are high, we were deeply deeply poorly staffed, and maybe because I had a lot of things on my plate. The nature of the burnout wasn't exhaustion, but defeat. Not "I'm tired", but "I've tried so hard and it's not going to work".

There were some other things I did that were good and fun, and hopefully successful! There were many joys that existed outside of that pesky vision-manifester-value. I spent a lot of effort giving interns a good experience, planned their intern retreat, got them referrals to future internships. In the recent months I poured everything into a technical project, and lived my dreams of performance work, learned C++ and finally got to practice navigating team-level politics.

But there was one specific problem for me that got in the way of the good things about Cohere, and that I won't name. Over the span of _months_ I bugged people about this, and kept running into walls of "talk to this person" and "[corporate phrase]" and couldn't talk to someone who would address it in a satisfying way to me. I eventually got an answer in a very civil, respectable and tragic conversation. It was that leadership genuinely didn't believe this was a problem and it turns out the main thing that was making my job unenjoyable was there by design.

The emotional significance of leaving a job is deeply underrated. It was a friend leaving who provided me activation energy and that friend felt strongly about me leaving even after having had her last day. I wrote some of this on my flight to Toronto to give notice and some on my flight back to San Francisco and cried in both directions (and of course, over that weekend). But it was time for me to go, because I'm not just upset over what's being left behind but over what it could've been.

> ive forgotten how to tell. did i ever even know?
> can i take another step? i've done everything I can
> all the people that i see, they will never understand

### Anthropic

There's some narrative that's only a little accurate where I was always supposed to go to [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/), that it was inevitable and the right choice for me from the get-go. I'm not really sure what my story with Anthropic is yet, but I don't think it was that easy? Like I said there were some close calls, but here are the two factors on which Anthropic stood out:

1. I believe that AGI is the most important problem of our time, both because it could be so bad and because we could make it so good. My actual beliefs are a lot more specific than this, and Anthropic (as well as its structural incentives) aligned most. This was captured in really heavy donation matching, not having investors waiting to be paid back, the existing and incoming work and the beliefs of the team there.
2. I know lots of people at Anthropic, and as mentioned, I care a lot about this. It's really comforting and provides lots of positive signal about what working at the company will be like.

The first time I heard of Anthropic I felt very detached from the AI Alignment scene, which was weird because I had been an EA and subscribed to the "buy lots of malaria nets" part for years. I warmed up to it a little bit and applied in fall of 2021 and got rejected. The things I discussed about alignment back then are very different from my thoughts now, which are also a little different from the ideas I had before I started this interview process (where Adept and Anthropic both moved some needles). That's nice, because this does genuinely seem like a "not a good fit at the time" situation (though it's also true that my interview performance changed a lot) It's also very sweet that Anthropic encouraged me to apply again so soon! I think their hiring ethos is [quite good](https://www.anthropic.com/#careers)

I am excited to be shown up in various and many ways, and of course excited for the growth that'll provide. The end of my recruiting journey doesn't end until I find my place and feel at home at Anthropic, and I can only expect that to be as lovely a process as the rest of it has been. If Anthropic resonates with you as a place to work, [here](https://www.anthropic.com/#job-postings) is where you apply.
