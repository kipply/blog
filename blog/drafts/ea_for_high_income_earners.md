# A Mundane Guide to Effective Altruism for People with High-Income

This introductory guide includes information about what effective altruism is, how you might go about becoming an effective altruist and what comes next. I call this guide "mundane" since having gotten into EA over the last year or so, I didn't have anything particularly EA-y in my life other than people. I'd never been particularly concerned with world poverty or AI Safety and to this day, have not read any EA-adjacent books. 

I refer to this guide as for "High-Income" people as it mostly covers a path of earning-to-give. This is probably very popular among my circles who are mostly software engineers, though it's important to note that *most* EAs are actually not involved through earn-to-give. In fact, there is evidence that most people who are earn-to-give could make a better contribution by working directly on EA causes. 

## 0. What is EA? 

Effective Altruism (proper noun, is an organization) is a movement to try to do the most good possible. Top causes include global poverty, climate change, AI risk, animal welfare, biosecurity, and of course, cause prioritization. EA also has [conferences](https://www.eaglobal.org/), [books](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/iekQZgWk48P7SC27L/effective-altruism-reading-list) on the subject, a [forum](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/), etc. People contribute to EA just by being a part of the community! Having a space where people can converse about  how to do good is extremely valuable. 

## 1. You should want to be an EA

There are a lot of benefits to being an EA! You get to help others which is obviously desirable. What people conceive to be undesirable about being an EA is the sacrifice, but I would fail to name any EAs who are constantly stressed out about all they've sacrificed. Part of the process of becoming an EA is being comfortable with your career change or monetary investment. Why wouldn't you want to become someone who is happy while being altruistic? 

## 2. Don't let them guilt you 

I'm sure psychologists and every human being has something to say about "are people more likely to do things out of guilt or out of the goodness of their hearts?". For my purposes, I don't care. I will do what makes me happy, and when I start on a line of thought like "there are children starving in Africa", my brain just wants to get rid of the thought and not think about it again. Once in a while, I'll go for the other method of relief which is to donate a bit, but this always seems like a temporary measure. More importantly, I'd prefer to be able to help out the world without having to suffer through a process of guilt. This is mostly achieved by gaining more initiative to help people, but I think you shouldn't feel bad if you refuse to be guilted. 

## 3. Dealing with your feelings

The weirdest thing about EA is that I don't get the same emotional response of giving 10k to a charity as I do dropping a dollar to a homeless fellow on my way to work. I personally haven't gotten around this, though I know some EAs who have. It is important to know of this effect, and perhaps overcome it. One of the easiest things to do is to not strictly be an EA. You can give effectively and still get the warm-fuzzies from volunteering at a soup kitchen or put money into pressing causes like 2020 BLM protesting.
