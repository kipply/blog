i have a fiction piece i wanna write about a future where some kid is doing history of science about ais that aren't quite agi
Seen
and then years later they end up teaming up with engineers
to realise that they can't get machine learning right because big array was wrong all along
and they should've used big graph
and they dig into history and find out why they stopped doing big graph
and realise that the means of compute are totes fucked for doing big graph
but i want it to be very technical fan faction
