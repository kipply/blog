# sensibility

there are five senses! each of them are great! i love all of them! 

they're so ingrained in how i experience, it feels shallow. the woes of betrayal and heartbreak are worth much more thought than tastes or sounds. many would disagree, as there is nature and music and the sciences of our nervous system that make them very pretty. 

here are a few of my favourite things about each of my senses, featuring a bonus sense: propioception 

### sight

the thing about sight, is that's it's the only one people regularly fear they lose (other than touch in some scenarios). being afraid of the dark is a common experience, which makes sight unique. 

for the same reasons that darkness is scary, sight is the sense we have the most control over. we choose where, when, if to look. people who have visualizations can choose what to look. unlike taste, we exercise this control constantly. it seems deeply psychologically damaging to have sight removed not just because of blindness, but because of the control you get in what you experience. 

in my dreams i can selectively taste, hear, smell things. if i could just turn off my sense of hearing or taste... no one could stop me. 

also your eyeballs are just crazy. they do bullshit like rotate in their socket and change colours over the years. 

### hearing

i'm attached to music (and taylor swift) so hearing is extra special to me. it is not as ethereal as sight, not as important. ears have pretty insane engineering too, but they are no eyeballs. 



### smell

i love smelling things! my favourite thing about smell, is that there's a lot more consensus on what smells good. feces bad, flowers good. there's no "art" or "taste" bullshit. not like how people have taste in music or find different people attractive or are ticklish. no, if it smells bad it just smells bad. 

### taste

enjoyment! i love food, and while i'd be most afraid to lose sight, taste is the one i actively enjoy every day. 

### touch



### proprioception
