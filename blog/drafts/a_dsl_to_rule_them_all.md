im a person who happens to think that compilers are the most purist and lovely form of software and i had only a small career stint to work on it
my coping mechanism has been slowly convincing myself that everything out there is a compiler, and specifically i've come up with a good case for the incoming agi to be a compiler -- more so than present day neural networks
this isn't an important or good idea by any means, but maybe one nice to read about and i plan on including a lot of Facts in here
its not fun to define the boundaries of "is this a compiler" but it is fun to show that we can think of other things the same way
lets start small, what are some things we know for sure are compilers? lets say a rust compiler, is a compiler. the properties that make it a compiler is that it's human readable code string in, machine executable code out.
its precise, it'll do exactly what we tell it (even if we don't tell it what we want) and in deterministic ways (maybe, jits are a thing)
